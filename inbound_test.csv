Kaspersky Faces Sanctions from U.S. Treasury Soon After Ban

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23854/ )

U.S. Treasury Sanctions 12 Kaspersky Executives Amid Software Ban
*What happened:* The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has *sanctioned* ( https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2420 ) twelve senior executives at Kaspersky Lab. The Department of Commerce also banned Kaspersky Lab and its affiliates from providing cybersecurity products in the U.S., citing national security risks and ties to Russian intelligence.
*Why it matters:* The sanctions block all property and interests of designated individuals and entities within the United States or controlled by U.S. persons. They also set precedents for foreign institutions engaging in significant transactions with the Russian military-industrial sector, thereby serving as a warning to entities actively facilitating or enabling activities that could compromise national security. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, Russia has criticized the U.S. sales ban on Kaspersky software, calling it a typical effort to stifle foreign competition in favor of American products. However, Kaspersky has maintained its stance of not being associated with the Russian government.

June 22, 2024
CDK Global Outage Reportedly Caused by BlackSuit Ransomware Attack
*What happened:* BlackSuit ransomware gang has been observed to be behind the recent CDK Global cyber incidents. The company is reportedly in talks with the gang to receive a decryptor and prevent associated data leaks as well. CDK has suffered two cyber incidents last week and was forced to bring some of its systems offline, including its customer support channels leaving clients with limited support options.
*Why it matters:* After the first breach, CDK Global decided to *rapidly* ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-hacked-again-while-recovering-from-first-cyberattack/ ) restore services after taking them down. Many expressed their concerns that such an action could endanger clients to fresh attacks. These attacks show that a more staggered approach to reviving offline systems may be instrumental in further protecting clients and the company from future attacks. Also, CDK Global is *warning* ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-warns-threat-actors-are-calling-customers-posing-as-support/ ) clients that non-CDK representatives are now contacting them on CDK’s behalf hoping to gain unauthorized access to systems. CDK is advising its clients to refrain from responding to such requests, as they are likely to be made by bad actors to facilitate follow-on attacks.

June 24, 2024
Chinese Hackers Step Up Attacks on Taiwanese Organizations
*What happened:* A Chinese state-sponsored hacking group, known as RedJuliett, intensified its cyberattacks targeting Taiwanese organizations, particularly in government, education, technology and diplomacy sectors. RedJuliett exploited vulnerabilities in SoftEther VPN software to breach the networks of various institutions, including government agencies in multiple countries, universities, and technology companies.
*Why it matters:* These cyberattacks underscore the escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, particularly in light of the new Taiwanese administration's perceived stance on independence. The scale and targets of the attacks suggest strategic interference, potentially aimed at gaining political and economic intelligence. RedJulliet, whose hacking patterns are observed to be similar to those of Chinese state-sponsored groups, has been noted attempting cyberattacks against more than 70 Taiwanese organizations. Earlier this month, *Palau* ( https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20240603/palau-taiwan-china-hack/ ) , one of Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, accused China after it suffered a cyberattack in March with more than 20,000 government documents stolen and later published on the dark web in April.

Caption:

**Apple is reportedly working on an AI partnership with Meta, which would integrate its AI capabilities into Apple Intelligence.** The deal is not the most obvious melding, as the tech giants have disagreed over Apple's 2021 privacy changes, which Meta said wiped out $10 billion of its revenue in 2022.

Apple is also working with Google on AI integration, as well as startups like Anthropic and Perplexity. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is not even paying OpenAI to put ChatGPT on iPhones.

Target is introducing its ""Store Companion chatbot"" to help employees perform their jobs and enhance the shopping experience. **The chatbot will be available on workers' handheld devices at all of Target's 2,000 stores.** The tool, developed in-house, will answer questions about processes and procedures.

Target is piloting the tool in about 400 stores before nationwide rollout. The chatbot will answer questions about the chain's loyalty card, product location, and cash register restarting. The goal is to empower team members and deliver a great guest experience.

**Nvidia has signed a deal to deploy its AI technology at data centers owned by Qatari telecoms group Ooredoo in five Middle Eastern countries.** This marks Nvidia's first large-scale launch in a region where Washington has curbed the export of sophisticated U.S. chips to prevent Chinese firms from using Middle Eastern countries as a back door to access AI technology.

The agreement will make Ooredoo the first company in the region to give clients of its data centers in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology. The deal will allow Ooredoo to better help its customers deploy generative AI applications.

Meta CTO Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth announced the largest restructuring of the company's hardware division since 2020, **merging all teams into two groups: a central ""Metaverse"" organization, which includes the Quest headset line, and a new ""Wearables"" organization, which includes all Meta's hardware efforts, including its smart glasses with Ray-Ban. **

Some employees in Reality Labs were also laid off, with the cuts focusing on teams where leadership roles are now redundant.

AI is driving the development of humanoid robots, with Tesla's Optimus being the most popular. Elon Musk has been optimistic about the robot's future, suggesting it could make Tesla a $25 trillion company. AI, specifically LLMs like ChatGPT, is opening up possibilities for humanoid robots, making them more collaborative, easier to understand commands, and more human-like.

**While ChatGPT has shown promise in making things look functional on the surface, its practical application in homes is still being explored. **Other factors contributing to the popularity of humanoid robots include research by Boston Dynamics and bot applications in factories.

Bevmax Office Centers employees will be off at 1:00PM on Wednesday, July 3,
2024.



The building and the Center will be open for your use.  However, there will
be no receptionist or Bevmax Office Centers personnel available, and the
building will operate on a holiday schedule on Thursday, July 4, 2024, which
means that the building will not provide: HVAC, cleaning services, and the
loading dock and freight elevators will not be open or operating.

problem, water damage, internet/telephone system breakdown), please contact

Plus, protests in Kenya, primary elections and “White Chicks” at 20. View in browser|nytimes.com June 26, 2024 Good morning. Today, we’re covering a favorable development for U.S. labor unions as well as protests in Kenya, primary elections and “White Chicks” at 20. At the Starbucks Workers United headquarters in Buffalo, N.Y. Libby March for The New York Times Coffee and a contract By Noam Scheiber  I cover workplace issues and the labor movement. Labor unions have won some big victories in the past few years, including in the auto industry and Hollywood. But if organized labor is going to have a true resurgence in the United States, it can’t simply win raises for workers it already represents. It will need to organize new workers and reverse the decades-long decline in union membership.  That’s why recent events at Starbucks have been so significant. The company and the union which represents more than 400 of Starbucks’s 10,000 U.S. stores appear on track to reach a contract that will cover wages, benefits and disciplinary policies.  This would be a major milestone. Even after workers win a union election, companies often drag their feet when bargaining a contract. If years pass with little or no progress, union supporters may get demoralized and leave, causing the union to unravel.  By contrast, a contract could encourage workers to unionize across Starbucks and other food and beverage chains, which are part of an industry that is overwhelmingly nonunion.  What’s remarkable about the Starbucks development is that it comes after the company spent years resisting the union campaign, which began in Buffalo in 2021. Starbucks’s former chief executive, Howard Schultz, portrayed organizers as outside agitators. He warned employees not to be “distracted” by them.  But in February the two sides announced that they would soon begin hashing out a framework for a contract. What explains the turnaround? In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four key factors. In Seattle, Wash. Grant Hindsley for The New York Times 1. A winning streak. While unions are broadly popular with Americans, they tend to be especially popular among the young and politically progressive, which describes much of Starbucks’s work force.  This made it difficult for Starbucks to contain the union’s growth. The campaign slowed down in mid-2022, when Schultz introduced benefits that did not apply to union stores. But organizers regained momentum as union supporters framed their campaign as a fight for liberal values like L.G.B.T.Q. rights. The union won roughly 100 elections in 2023, which kept the campaign in the news and made it tough for Starbucks to wait it out.  2. A new boss. Schultz, who spent decades at Starbucks before retiring in 2018, returned to the top job in 2022. He focused on fixing operational issues like outdated equipment and store layouts, which he appeared to believe had fueled the union campaign and promised to find a successor quickly. That turned out to be Laxman Narasimhan, the C.E.O. of Reckitt, a consumer products company based in England.  Though little was known about Narasimhan’s feelings on unions at the time, Starbucks corporate officials who worked with him later told me that he took a pragmatic view believing it could be less costly to engage the union than to fight it. His stance differed from that of Schultz, who viewed the union as a personal affront. It appeared to threaten his self-image as a generous boss.  3. External pressure. Socially minded investors pressed Starbucks to commission a report on its labor practices. It found that the company had fallen short of its commitments on labor rights. A coalition of unions spent heavily to back three labor-friendly candidates for seats on Starbucks’s board. And the company became a target of protests and boycotts tied to the war in Gaza, which escalated after Starbucks sued the union over social media posts supportive of Palestinians. In Oakland, Calif. Mike Kai Chen for The New York Times It’s hard to know how much these developments weighed on the company, but Starbucks appeared to take them seriously. It announced a new board committee to oversee employee relations shortly before it released the labor report. The company began talks with the union on how to bargain a contract a few weeks before the scheduled vote on the labor-friendly board candidates. And Narasimhan suggested on an earnings call that the protests and boycotts were having “a negative impact” on business even though they were “driven by misperceptions.”  4. Government help. U.S. labor law is relatively weak: If a company fires an employee for union organizing, the National Labor Relations Board can seek back pay. But it can’t fine the employer. And the process often takes years.  Still, the N.L.R.B. tends to be more active and creative under Democratic administrations. It has been especially active and creative and under President Biden. The board issued more than 100 complaints against Starbucks and went to court to reinstate workers it deemed to have been wrongly fired (though the Supreme Court just reined in this practice). The board even said it would begin ordering unions into existence if an employer’s labor-law violations affected the outcome of a union election.  Though Starbucks consistently denied wrongdoing and appealed findings against it, the board’s actions were another source of pressure that raised the cost of fighting the union.  A programming note: David Leonhardt is off until next week, and other Times journalists will continue writing the newsletter until then. THE LATEST NEWS Primary Elections Jamaal Bowman Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times In New York, George Latimer, a centrist challenger, defeated the progressive congressman Jamaal Bowman.  Bowman is the first of the “squad” an influential group of left-wing House members to lose a seat. Read takeaways.  In Colorado, Lauren Boebert won a crowded Republican primary, nearly guaranteeing she will serve another two years in Congress. More on Politics The judge who presided over Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial ruled that Trump can now criticize the prosecution witnesses.  Oklahoma’s Supreme Court blocked state funding for what would have been the nation’s first religious charter school.  Biden is expected today to pardon around 2,000 veterans convicted of engaging in gay sex, which was outlawed by a military code for more than 60 years.  Biden administration officials urged medical experts to remove age minimums for surgeries from their transgender medical care guidelines, emails show.  In more than 50 years in Washington, Biden has learned to make deals and work across the aisle. It is an old-school instinct rarely rewarded in today’s political climate, Peter Baker writes. Kenya Protesters in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Brian Inganga/Associated Press Crowds of Kenyans stormed their Parliament building and set fire to its entrance in protest against a bill raising taxes.  President William Ruto called the protesters treasonous and deployed the military to quell the demonstration. At least five people were killed, human rights groups said.  The tax bill would raise the price of diapers, eggs and phone data, among other things. Officials say it’s needed to pay off Kenya’s debt.  Auma Obama, a Kenyan British activist who is a half sister of Barack Obama, was tear-gassed as she spoke about her opposition to the bill on CNN. See the video.  Kenya is among Africa’s fastest-growing economies, yet the benefits have not reached many ordinary people. The unrest is a sign of a growing economic crisis across the continent.  On the same day, 400 Kenyan police officers arrived in Haiti which has been plagued by gang violence to restore order. Israel-Hamas War Waiting to receive food in southern Gaza. Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock An international group of experts said nearly half a million people in Gaza were at risk of starvation.  Hamas said a sister of its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli strike on their family home. Haniyeh leads the group from exile in Qatar.  The U.S. and Israeli defense secretaries met in Washington to discuss the intensifying conflict along Israel’s border with Lebanon. Russia The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich went on trial today in Russia on espionage charges. Russia has presented no evidence of his guilt, and the trial is being held in secret.  The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two top Russian security officials over strikes against Ukraine’s power plants. Other Big Stories The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Espionage Act, securing his freedom under a plea deal. He was sentenced to time served in Britain and has returned home to Australia.  A new space race: The U.S. and China are competing to build permanent outposts at the moon’s most strategic location, the lunar south pole, The Wall Street Journal reports. Opinions  What do Biden and Trump need to do to win the presidential debate? The most important thing is to be energetic, say Chris Whipple and Kristen Soltis Anderson.  Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak and five other prominent Israelis urge Congress to disinvite Benjamin Netanyahu from its joint session next month.

As I read about *Jericho Security*'s innovative approach to AI-powered

own risk management and compliance solutions can complement your
groundbreaking work. Your recent pre-seed funding round, secured to build
solutions using machine-learning capabilities to ""fight AI with AI,""
resonates deeply with our mission to automate risk management and
compliance for tech companies.

I'd love to explore how our tailored, preventive insurance solutions can
enhance your existing security measures, leveraging our AI-driven platform
to streamline compliance and enhance risk controls. For instance, our
platform offers incentives like a 1,000 credit towards SOC 2 certification
for customers. Would you be open to discussing how Koop can support Jericho

Cloud Computing 2024
<https://www.tmcnet.com/tmc/poty/default.aspx?AwardID=677>

 	 9th Annual | Early Bird Application Deadline Tomorrow –
Thursday, June  27

Nominate Your Cloud Security Solutions:
Raise Your Brand Reputation | Reach New Levels of Market Share


Dear Colleague,

It's time to apply for Cloud Computing Magazine and TMCnet's 2024 Cloud
Security Excellence Awards
<https://www.tmcnet.com/tmc/poty/default.aspx?AwardID=677> .

Based on actual client case studies or success stories, these awards
instantly set you apart in a crowded market. Being selected as a winner
proves without a doubt that your solutions are not only ready for
deployment, but proven to solve your client’s cloud security challenges.


*	You’ve helped secure business applications, infrastructure,
services, networks and devices
*	You’ve demonstrated leadership and innovation
*	And you’ve proven that your solutions is effective in minimizing
the evolving threat landscape

>> SPECIAL NOTICE <<
Tomorrow, Thursday, June 27 is the early bird application deadline.
Apply by end of the day tomorrow to save $100 off your professing fee.

Cloud Security Excellence Award winners will be named in two categories.

Cloud-Delivered Security
With the ever-increasing number of hacks and intrusions, ensuring
security of our applications, services, data, and devices has never been
more critical. Virtualization and Cloud Computing – much as they have
for other services – have created a market for security to be delivered
to enterprises via the cloud, thus ensuring a highly scalable and
geographically indiscriminate security solution without increasing the
burden on internal IT. If you are one of those security solutions
leveraging the cloud as your delivery model, this is your chance to
differentiate your offer from your competitors at a time when everyone
should be focused on ensuring their security partners are up to speed.

Cloud Security
For years, one of the chief causes of delay or even rejection of cloud
migration has been security. The notion that critical data is stored in
facilities outside the enterprise’s sphere of control came with a degree
of fear. Even with the reassurances from both the cloud and security
players that security remains a top priority, the knowledge that that
threat matrices are ever-evolving leaves little room for error. If your
product or service is among those keeping cloud infrastructure and
applications secure, ensure you receive the recognition you deserve –
apply today for the Cloud Security Excellence Awards.

This is a solution-level award, so please submit individual applications
and success stories for each worthy product/service.

ITEXPO Expands for 2025

ITEXPO, one of the largest and longest-running technology trade shows in
the United States, recently announced a major expansion for 2025.

After selling out of exhibit space in 2024, ITEXPO 2025 will occupy Expo
Halls A and B – doubling the available exhibit space, and adding
15 new premium meeting rooms for exhibitors and sponsors.

In addition, the ITEXPO conference program has added eight new, larger
breakout rooms to the conference programming. Many sessions
across ITEXPO and its collocated events exceeded their room capacity in
2024. The move to the larger spaces ensures attendees will not
get shut out of their chosen sessions.

Since 1999, ITEXPO has been the annual gathering where enterprise/SMB
technology professionals, MSPs, resellers and other channel
partners, service providers, and solutions providers converge to explore
the latest advancements in communications and technology.

For 2025, the expansion of ITEXPO includes:

*	100% growth in exhibit space
*	Addition of 15 new premium, private meeting spaces for
exhibitors and sponsors
*	Expansion of Generative AI Expo content to two tracks
*	Addition of two new collocated events:

	*	Enterprise Cybersecurity Expo
	*	Intelligent Video Expo

*	Return of popular collocated events:

	*	MSP Expo
	*	Future of Work Expo
	*	Future of CX Expo
	*	Enterprise Metaverse Expo
	*	IoT Evolution Expo

Facing a cybersecurity workforce shortage amidst new threats to national security, government agencies are more vulnerable than ever before. <https://link.govexec.com/click/35851029.101260/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292ZXhlYy5jb20vc3BvbnNvci1jb250ZW50L0FUVC1OYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS1uZXR3b3JrLW1vZGVybml6YXRpb24tYnJpbmdzLXVuaXF1ZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLz9vcmVmPW5nZmN3X2Z0dF9ubA/65c10fd84754d15f021122cbFceb3c836>

New technologies have brought high rewards, but perhaps even higher risks. With IT worker shortages spanning across all sectors, government agencies are focusing on the mission while contracting with experts to manage their networks. By developing relationships with industry leaders, national security agencies are able to focus on the mission without having to worry about heightened security concerns, new regulations, compliance issues, and outdated systems that no longer work.

Hey Madison,


Quick question - how long does your team spend on filling out vendor assessments?


I'm going to guess a lot of time based off my previous experience as a VP of Sales. That's why I built TrustHub, an AI powered tool that allows you to fill out vendor/security assessments in minutes versus days. We help sales team save 20+ hours per month filling out vendor assessments.


The way it works is quite simple, you load your account with previously completely assessments and you and our AI can fill out new assessments for you in seconds using your knowledgeable of Q&A's.


We are running promotion for only $99 a month and you can cancel at anytime. SIGN UP HERE.

This month, we’ve got Coda Brain—our new
turnkey AI platform—on the brain. And we can’t stop wondering
about the ways AI will change the way we work together. You could
say we’ve got a one-track mind, but let’s not overdo the puns.

​

So, here’s a roundup of all our favorite AI takes, templates,
and thinking this month, from great minds in and outside of Coda.

Hi Dan ,

At Pieces for Developers, we know that managing and referencing your saved code snippets should be a seamless experience. That's why we've created different ways for you to access your personal Pieces repository with features designed to enhance your workflow and organization.

 

1. Reference your Code with Ease: List View vs. Gallery View

 

* List View: Optimized for quick browsing, our list view allows you to sort your snippets in various ways * Recent: Chronological by most recently added.
* Suggested: Chronological by most recently added.
* Alphabetical by Title: Chronological by most recently added.
* Alphabetical by Language: Chronological by most recently added.
* Gallery View: Ideal for viewing large code snippets in detail.
 

By switching between these views, you can find exactly what you need without any hassle.

 

2. Auto-Enrich your Code with Context and Metadata

* Title + Description: Quickly understand what a snippet does without having to open it.
* Tags: Find your materials faster in search with tags that categorize and identify code snippets.
* Related Links: Learn more about a snippet or revisit the origin website you saved it from.
* Related People: Keep track of collaborators on each snippet. This data keeps your copilot informed on organization roles!
* Sensitive Information: Save snippets without worrying about API keys, personal information, and more. We’ll flag it and notify you before sharing!
* Custom Metadata: Add, edit and delete any context and metadata attached to your code snippets - you have complete control.
3. Amplify your Collaboration with Cloud Integrations and Personalized Shareable Links

* GitHub Gists Integration ( https://docs.pieces.app/product-highlights-and-benefits/saving-to-and-from-github-gists?utm_campaign=Welcome+3.0&utm_content=%283%29+Explore+your+Pieces+Repository&utm_medium=transactional&utm_source=customerio ): Import saved snippets or share new snippets in Pieces as Gists directly.
*
Microsoft Teams Integration ( https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/teams?utm_campaign=Welcome+3.0&utm_content=%283%29+Explore+your+Pieces+Repository&utm_medium=transactional&utm_source=customerio ): Discover and save snippets right from your Teams chats.
*
Custom Pieces Subdomain ( https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing?utm_campaign=Welcome+3.0&utm_content=%283%29+Explore+your+Pieces+Repository&utm_medium=transactional&utm_source=customerio ): Claim your custom subdomain to send personalized shareable links. Each link contains your code and AI-enriched context and metadata, improving collaboration efficiency.

At Pieces for Developers, we strive to make every aspect of your coding experience smooth and efficient. We hope you take full advantage of these features, designed to boost your productivity and facilitate collaboration.
