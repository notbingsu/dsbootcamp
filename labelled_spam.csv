I've been closely following Jericho Security's LinkedIn, its headcount and
the industry you operate. Am I wrong to assume that you might benefit from

services, powered by the top 1% of developers in Latin America. Our team is
not only highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also speak fluent
English and share the same time zone, ensuring seamless collaboration.

We've had the privilege of partnering with industry giants like Google,
Rolls-Royce, and Pinterest, but also with companies similar to yours,
delivering tailored solutions that have significantly boosted their growth.

We're confident that we can do the same for Jericho Security.

Here's what sets us apart:

   - Access to senior software engineers with an average of 10+ years of
   experience
   - Quick onboarding of top LATAM tech talent within 2-4 weeks
   - Award-winning, industry-leading software outsourcing services

I'd love to discuss how we can tailor our services to meet Jericho

bcc_email_sec_inbound,founderhub@peachscore.com,"Hi Sage,

Great news! Your company has been pre-selected for Peachscore's accelerator, investment, and mentorship program for the next Cohort.

To give you a brief overview, Peachscore was established by a former partner and founding COO of Plug and Play (https://d2mdlx04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mdlx04/VWzKYC2T3bRVN5rrSDWyFJFWW70RWGB5fjTH5N3Lg88z3lcq-W7lCdLW6lZ3nbW5j1Dmz7HmNjHW4dMn6w2bK14rW5SZnDT3RGqwJW1ClsCy5b_HxCW3fq0_Z96ljrgW4rDfCM4BgbZzW1JH6354PkX34W86C-3w7k0NZ8W4sxmZq1pDRLDW58L4G583kXkwW8jTzxv8wdZ2xW8LxqbD7fkGYWW6cxQW07WcnLPW2SZGxm46t6x3W1JqLvR8KxWT4W4R8nHb2hZYz2W4b8GbN8l672wW2h5df63bPpZMW1BTRrg6zDMDrW3swgC337NjfzV-mqsh4t3zK8W87qBs33myrRzW34-__S1rt7GXW5Td0HM3xBGG6f3PdnWW04 ) and is supported by Plug and Play as a key shareholder. Peachscore's mission is to democratize access and help increase founders' chances of success through structured education, investment, and advisory programs. With our roots deeply planted in Silicon Valley, we provide programs for founders at the early stage, including the idea stage to Series A.

Peachscore was founded to address the challenges founders face in the startup ecosystem in gaining access to support. To understand the gravity of the problem, about 1M startups annually apply to accelerator-only programs, and only 18,000 startups worldwide have the chance to gain admission, leaving more than 98% of founders underserved and underrepresented.

At Peachscore, we are committed to helping you succeed if you are committed to doing the work. With over 100 years of combined founding team experience, we understand how vulnerable startups are in the first 24 months of their journey, and our mission is to mitigate your risk and significantly increase your chances of success by helping you with a framework to build a scalable venture and access to appropriate funding sources and advisors through these critical times.

Our program includes:

- A 12-week, data-driven accelerator program culminating in graduation and an online demo day.
- 1 year of support and access to the Peachscore ecosystem.
- Showcasing your company to the ecosystem of 300+ corporate executives, 100+ universities, 2k+ investors, and 40+ government agencies.
- Access to mentorship, office hours, and daily advisory sessions.
- Intensive learning, benchmarking your company against 600k other startups in the market, business intelligence, strategic growth, industry awareness, and in-depth platform recommendations.
- Access to a catalog of $2M in Perks offered by our partners.
- Exclusive pitching sessions and VIP event access.
- Chance to secure up to $500k in investment through Peachscore Capital and its partners.

Peachscore growth program is industry-agnostic, equity-free, online, and global.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,joe.moreno@retentionconsultingagencygroup.com,"Hi there Sage,

If you already filed for the ERC program and you’re still waiting, this could interest you.

Processing wasn’t restarted on Jan 1st as planned, and there’s little guidance as to when they will process claims again, leaving anyone that has filed in the last 6 months with a 1 year (or longer) wait time for checks.

If you are still waiting and would like get your money in two weeks, we are able to buy your claim for 75c on the dollar and we will wait out the eventual arrival of the ERC refund.

Would you be interested in this?

I recently reached out regarding our sales intelligence platform, but I
worry I may be contacting the wrong person. Time and again, studies find
that those who know their accounts, markets, and buyers consistently
outsell less informed competitors. Still, companies continue to have their
sales reps ask generic questions such as ""What keeps you up at night? What
challenges are you facing? Who do you currently use?"".

With primary-sourced insights into the world’s most complex buyers,
Emissary gives you a crystal ball on how to sell to your most desirable
customers.

Is there someone on your team that could benefit from this?

I'm reaching out to discuss how Jericho Security updates its development

I contact one of your colleagues?

Madison,

If you´re evaluating SDR alternatives, we might be able to help each other.

We partner with tech companies to increase sales pipeline and grow revenue by delivering qualified at-bats for their sales team. We do this by providing dedicated outbound SDRs who set qualified meetings for your sales team via a multi-channel outreach approach including via phone, email, and LinkedIn . We have a deep bench of trained SDRs who are all based in the US, trained in-house, and ready to plug in to your outbound sales strategy.

With that said, let me take a step back here and ask - are you the best person to talk to about outbound lead generation?

Cheers,

Maya

Specifically, we often jump in when companies haven’t yet built
out a full finance function. I didn’t notice any finance titles @
Jericho Security... I’m guessing you’re attempting to handle the
finance efforts yourself? Or maybe with a solo team member or a
bookkeeping service?

We’ve seen too many founders and operators fly blind. Every
startup needs a full finance stack (even very early stage) to
understand the economics of their businesses.

With us, you’ll get a whole team of experts in different
disciplines when you need them, including CFO, controller,
accounting manager, etc. -- so you can focus on big picture areas
like growth and strategy.

Happy to connect if you'd like.

Let me know when you have some
time -- maybe on Tuesday?

I wanted to bump this because if you would like to use your anticipated refund now and not in the future this will interest you. 

We are willing to purchase your employee retention tax credit claim for 75c on the dollar, and you could get your money within two weeks.

If you’ve already gotten your employee retention tax credit refund just reply “received”.

Would you be interested in this?


Thanks,
Joe

Hi Daniel,

Legacy SSOs, such as Okta and Microsoft Entra ID, were built for productivity and have failed in security.

That’s why Beyond Identity is excited to launch today our Secure Access platform.

It is the first identity access management platform, designed to secure the most vulnerable part of your environment against current and future threats while being simple to administer and easy to use.

Secure Access includes:

- Secure SSO
- Passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA
- Deep device risk insights
- Continuous authentication
- Robust third-party integrations

bcc_email_sec_inbound,tim@timparkin.com,"Chris,​I’ve got a surprise for you.​Yesterday was the Marketing
Leader Roundtable and the feedback was amazing! 🥳​We covered a
bunch of stuff, like…​The classic marketing Project Dilemma that
kills most projects before they start (and how to solve it)…​How
to finish projects faster by using the Kinetic Kickoff (people
loved this)..​And the problem with generating demand and how to
Build Instant Demand using something most marketers are
completely overlooking (but the most successful brands use).​I
even walked through a practical example of building instant
demand for one company that resulted in 3.6X more applications
(without spending more money).​Plus, everyone shared some of
their favorite marketing tools.​I don’t normally share the
recording for the Marketing Leader Roundtable, but…​Everyone was
asking for it and I know these strategies will have a huge impact
for you.​​But first - an important update:​​We’ve filled all the
spots in May for The Advisory Board so I’ve opened up a few spots
for June.​The Advisory Board is a coaching group for marketing
directors.​Inside, we help you simplify, systematize, and scale
your marketing…​By giving you everything you need to crush your
goals and advance your career.​And we do it by walking you
through the Marketing Director Roadmap…​So you always know your
right next step and have the training, coaching, and peer support
to make progress faster, get bigger results, and gain the skills
you need.​​If you want all the details, reply with “GROUP” and
I’ll send them over.​​And now…​​» Here’s the link to the replay
of the Marketing Leader Roundtable​ (

)​I hope you find it valuable and useful.​Have an amazing weekend
and look out for details on the next roundtable!​--Tim Parkin

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding the exclusive opportunity to meet with Surekha Tech's CEO during his visit in The USA.

We understand your busy schedule and appreciate your time. If your calendar allows, could we schedule a brief meeting at your earliest convenience?

Thank you for considering this, and we look forward to the possibility of connecting soon.

Here’s how the multi-channel lead ranking process works:

   1. Send AI-driven emails with automated follow up sequencing based on
   engagement
   2. Automatically connect and DM prospects on linkedin when they engage
   with emails
   3. Identify person-level website visitors real time
   4. Cold-call prospects real time when they are identified on the site,
   after engaging with the other channels.

We are averaging about a 40% conversion rate on the leads that answer a
cold call.

I know this could sound a bit pushy, but I’d hate to give up on helping you.

Especially since I know we can help you scale your IT company (and I guarantee results).

So should I stay or should I go?

I’ve tried to reach you a few times but haven’t heard back which tells me 1 of 3 things:

● You’re all set and I should stop bothering you.
● You’re still interested but haven’t had the time or energy to get back to me yet.
● You’re just too busy right now. If so, simply reply with how many months I should wait before getting back in touch (fingers crossed the number is less than 100).

If you are busy, how can I stay in touch without being annoying?

If you aren’t interested, do I have your permission to close your file?

If you’re still interested, what do you recommend as the next step?

Thanks for your help,

bcc_email_sec_inbound,founderhub@peachscore.com,"Hi Sage,

Backed by 100+ years of cumulative research in venture capital, Peachscore was built to accelerate founders' success through the growth program. Startups can gain access to structured ongoing education, mentorship, networking, and potential investment opportunities similar to Y Combinator startups!

Startups are at high risk of failure in the first two years of their venture, and the right education and mentorship, along with meeting the right investors, play a crucial role in establishing a solid company.

Where can founders access all these resources in one place? The answer is accelerator programs. Unfortunately, out of 1.6 million annual startup applicants to accelerators, only 18,000 gain admission worldwide. This means that over 99% of founders are underserved and overlooked, leading to wasted time and missed visibility.

At Peachscore, we prioritize minimizing risk for founders. As analyzed by TechCrunch, the chance of startups graduating from an accelerator program increases by 50% to secure their Series A financing.

Explore how Peachscore supports startups in this short video.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,evadaniel@gosuperiortech.co,"Hi Sage,

I'd like to test the waters for a potential technical partnership between
our companies.

With Superior Technologies, Jericho Security can create stable, scalable,
high-performance, and well-documented software systems. Our rates are
highly competitive compared to other American-based companies, and we have
significantly higher skill levels than offshore outsourcing firms.

Service Express, Bosch Automotive, and Corewell Health have chosen us as
their tech partner, and we're enthusiastic about bringing value to Jericho
Security as well.

Would you be available for a conversation next Tuesday or Wednesday if I
piqued your interest?

Best,
Eva

Sorry to bother you again, but I am unsure if you received my first email.

While we take a giant leap to a digital-only world, engaging videos will be
critical for Agolo

Companies like Fujitsu and Lenovo hire us to handcraft animated videos that
would:

1. Distill their complex ideas into digestible content.
2. Highlight the key value proposition to their prospects.
3. Help them stand out from the competition.
4. Help them emotionally connect with their audience.
5. Build brand trust and enable the sales team.

Sage, we are excited to be in conversation with you and look forward to
discussing how we have been helping companies like Agolo to tell great
stories.

Can we connect over a quick call? Lmk.

Keep telling great stories,

Mousumi Sarangi

Most conversations around Identity Resilience focus on the prevention of attacks. But as statistics increasingly show that a major breach is a matter of “when”, not “if”, CISOs are realizing that their Identity Resilience strategy is missing a critical piece: response.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,mandri@capital-placement.com,"Hi Daniel,
I hope you're doing well.
I'll get straight to the point because I don't want to waste your time.
Here is why you shouldn't let me sit in your inbox:We save you time by hand-picking profiles for Jericho Security after assessing over 500 candidates.These remote interns will work for Jericho Security for 40 hours a week and take a monthly stipend of only $800 - $1000.There is zero recruitment cost to you, as the candidate is our customer and not the employer.All of our candidates are Multilingual.Our collaboration would save you time and money in exchange for brilliant young talent that could potentially become permanent future hires - everyone wins!The next steps are straightforward.I will send you a shortlist of candidates.Pick the candidate you would like to interview and respond to this email with their name and the role you have in mind.I will schedule a 30-minute interview on Zoom or Google Meet between you and the candidate.After the call, you can extend an offer letter.The placement will be confirmed and the candidates start on the agreed-upon start date.Sounds too good to be true?Look us up here or let our interns vouch for us.
Do you prefer in-person interns?We can help you there too!
Still not convinced?Let's jump on a quick call this week and let me tell you more.
Let me know when you are available and I can schedule a call, alternatively, you can book a call with me by clicking here.
If this isn't relevant, let me know and you won't hear from me again. 
Kind Regards,  Mandri

- In the Kixie PowerCall Chrome extension, agents will be auto-prompted to install PowerCall Version 2.34.0. They can also force the update themselves via PowerCall Settings → App Update.

Highlighted Features and Enhancements

Schedule a Call Task when PowerDialing

- When PowerDialing, your agents can now schedule a call task that logs to the CRM (and their CRM-connected calendar if enabled).

Pause/Unpause Recordings

- Agents can now easily Pause and Unpause Call Recordings during a call, allowing them to prevent sensitive data from being recorded.

Hubspot Enhancements:

- After re-connecting your Kixie PowerCall to HubSpot (https://d2qCdQ04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/UB+113/d2qCdQ04/VVQdSq95rcb2W7JrMH29c-k1NW3hB9jJ5fKshBN7-7xzY3pyd0W95jsWP6lZ3pRW4Hdnd11M-VFZW3YTFb55fvGnzN5BBgVTPL3vmMNNRZpZdHygW3W8FQN7W-p6kW1xycdq8tpZgvV4JqVY5WMzbGW3qcwcV80DCXvVGFwP-3-FHh8W5Tb0Z04t4N3XW4X0GKf5LlHFJW1fXNjV5FwrvxW5xY64h5QtjK9W4xRhMS6lQnBwW2ty6px6l84ncW77w_BC9fht44W7HBV369lFQxgW2Xk6X17bF8YwW4Q4ZY_1ljR1zW59VHVs5g9vsHW5sfLMB3QwBqYW2nzpD23_Cb6_W2DtgMB5h841WV8-c9X4ZF_phW333JHy1nCPvNW22Q5Dq4ct9kgW62j_r71lFrm1N44nB5n-CdDXW7dg2XV96fWq4W2qdznC4T3ZSvf3zPt1q04 ) , you'll be able to directly import a HubSpot contact list into a PowerList, eliminating the need to export/import. Active lists will be imported statically.
- Under Account Settings -> CRM Properties, you can now declare custom phone fields as ""Phone"" properties, and Kixie will then integrate activities with those custom HubSpot phone fields.

Transfer/Conference Enhancements

- Agents can now retrieve Held Calls that were previously lost when the agent's internet connection was temporarily severed or the agent reloaded PowerCall, preventing parties from becoming stuck on hold.
- Agents now receive an in-app notification saying ""Party Has Left The call"" when a caller on hold hangs up.

Assign CRM Contact Owner On PowerList Disposition

- You can now use a PowerList Disposition rule to assign the agent as the CRM contact owner. For example, ""Appointment Set"" can remove the contact from the PowerList AND make the setter the CRM contact owner.

Recently Added Features and Enhancements

Speed to Lead ""Highest-Priority"" PowerLists (https://d2qCdQ04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/UB+113/d2qCdQ04/VVQdSq95rcb2W7JrMH29c-k1NW3hB9jJ5fKshBN7-7xzF3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3nfW8h2yF16mQ-2_W8KzBfy9d0FPFW1XmrtY7BWLwdVN63Rj9lsrDlW9dqtYs4mmHs1VfWt778nHWzTW5GXFFz2yHzqfW4vv3JH1cymm6W5hKsLw2NrQTnW1d_sMt7FTTT0VY1pJV6F_6R5W7Yxf8L3-LB8xW8tGLBv7V9S4VW4qxbCr4R9xkbN8sJ-R3pMwLZVj5N7f7TmjGdW3_4sQN4MvL7FW1Swj6K7g2c5TW6NL5_x4qwj2rW3c84DP63JxK9W5MsWZb7_hdLWW1mn8rX6JnzSZW46X7j383Y8KvVrC2_K4FVWkfV9gv4588rny7F4SJhgkJpnZW9gz4lm9bFpZQW9gH_q97Q90RZf34GqHM04 )

- You can use the ""Add Contact to PowerList"" action to send hot leads into a 'Highest' Priority PowerList to ensure that they will be served up to your agents as their next PowerDial.
- You can create a speed-to-lead + continuous followup system by automatically forwarding your contacts from higher-priority PowerLists to lower-priority PowerLists after completing a certain number of dial attempts.

CRM Properties

- In Manage -> Account Settings, you can sync contact properties over from your CRM, and select specific properties for your agents to use in their Kixie SMS templates.

Hey rockstar,

We released our first product eight months ago, allowing anyone to make a song with just a simple idea. 12 million of you have now made music with Suno, and we have been deeply inspired by the songs you have created. We've seen friends exchanging memes, couples trading love songs and streamers co-creating songs with stadium-sized audiences. Some make songs for others, while others play, explore and make songs for themselves.

We are very excited to announce that throughout the remainder of 2024, we will be paying a total of $1 million to these creators who are bringing us closer to music, and each other, with Suno. We are kicking things off with the Summer of Suno, a celebration of the songs that move us as a community — whether they make us bob our heads, tap our feet, laugh, cry or simply say ""wow.""

The Summer of Suno (SoS), Vol. 1 starts tomorrow on Saturday, June 1st. We are paying out the first $100,000 of the total $1 million prize pool to the creators of the top 500 songs made with Suno during the month of June. All public songs will be automatically enrolled in SoS Vol. 1, and song rank will be determined by plays, likes and shares. 

 

We can't wait to see what you make.

Hey rockstar,

We released our first product eight months ago, allowing anyone to make a song with just a simple idea. 12 million of you have now made music with Suno, and we have been deeply inspired by the songs you have created. We've seen friends exchanging memes, couples trading love songs and streamers co-creating songs with stadium-sized audiences. Some make songs for others, while others play, explore and make songs for themselves.

We are very excited to announce that throughout the remainder of 2024, we will be paying a total of $1 million to these creators who are bringing us closer to music, and each other, with Suno. We are kicking things off with the Summer of Suno, a celebration of the songs that move us as a community — whether they make us bob our heads, tap our feet, laugh, cry or simply say ""wow.""

The Summer of Suno (SoS), Vol. 1 starts tomorrow on Saturday, June 1st. We are paying out the first $100,000 of the total $1 million prize pool to the creators of the top 500 songs made with Suno during the month of June. All public songs will be automatically enrolled in SoS Vol. 1, and song rank will be determined by plays, likes and shares. 

 

We can't wait to see what you make.

Hi Chris, yes, we can certainly meet your lead profile criteria. Given
titles are sometimes slightly modified company-to-company can we also
generate leads from similar types of titles? if so, would you like me to
send over an SOW for you to review? How many leads would you like me to
include in the SOW? I look forward to hearing from you. Best, Joan

THE UNEXPECTED TWIST: HOW WE GOT THERE:=========================================
The quest for the holy grail of automation. It`s a journey I`ve been on myself, with twists and turns that would make even the most seasoned navigator pause. But fear not, dear reader, for I shall regale you with tales of triumph and tribulation, garnered from my own experiences in the trenches of Enterprise Automation. 
In our organization, the quest began with a clear vision: to integrate multiple systems, processes, and stakeholders to optimize business outcomes and improve operational efficiency. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, let me tell you, it`s not as straightforward as it seems. The path was riddled with obstacles, missteps, and downright frustrations. 
The first hurdle we encountered was the sheer complexity of our existing infrastructure. A tangled web of disparate systems, processes, and data formats, each with its own set of quirks and idiosyncrasies. It was like trying to build a house on shaky ground – you can`t just start hammering away without a solid foundation. 
So, we took a step back, assessed the landscape, and charted our course. We identified key stakeholders, mapped out our processes, and developed a comprehensive strategy for integration. Ah, but then came the inevitable challenge: change management. Resistance to change is like trying to move a stubborn boulder – it takes persistence, patience, and a healthy dose of creativity. 
One memorable moment was when we introduced an automated workflow tool to streamline a particularly convoluted process. The initial response from our team members was, shall we say, less than enthusiastic. Why fix what ain`t broke? they`d say. But we persisted, armed with data-driven insights and compelling business cases. Slowly but surely, the tide began to shift, as employees saw the benefits of automation firsthand. 
As we navigated this choppy waters, I couldn`t help but wonder: What`s the secret sauce behind successful Enterprise Automation? After all, it`s not just about slapping together a few tools and calling it a day. No, no – it requires a deep understanding of human psychology, organizational dynamics, and technological wizardry. 
Here are some actionable steps that have worked for us:
1. Start small: Don`t try to boil the ocean in one go. Start with a narrow focus area, demonstrate success, and then scale up. 2. Involve stakeholders: Listen to their concerns, address their fears, and empower them to drive change. 3. Map your processes: Identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement. 4. Develop a comprehensive strategy: Integrate technology, people, and processes to achieve optimal outcomes. 5. Monitor and adjust: Continuously track progress, refine your approach, and adapt to changing circumstances. 
Throughout this journey, I`ve come to realize that Enterprise Automation is not just about technology – it`s about people, process, and culture. It`s about creating a harmonious symphony of automation, where each component plays its part in harmony. 
As we look back on our odyssey, I`m struck by the wisdom of an old friend: The only constant is change. In today`s fast-paced, ever-evolving business landscape, Enterprise Automation is not just a nice-to-have – it`s a must-have. And if you`re willing to put in the effort, take calculated risks, and stay flexible, I reckon you`ll find yourself sailing into calmer waters, with a treasure trove of benefits waiting at the horizon. 
So, go forth, dear reader, and chart your own course. May the winds of change guide you, and may your Enterprise Automation journey be filled with triumphs and tales to tell!

Hi Daniel,


I hope you're doing well.


I'll get straight to the point because I don't want to waste your time.


Here is why you shouldn't let me sit in your inbox:

We save you time by hand-picking profiles for Jericho Security after assessing over 500 candidates.
These remote interns will work for Jericho Security for 40 hours a week and take a monthly stipend of only $800 - $1000.
There is zero recruitment cost to you, as the candidate is our customer and not the employer.
All of our candidates are Multilingual.
Our collaboration would save you time and money in exchange for brilliant young talent that could potentially become permanent future hires - everyone wins!

The next steps are straightforward.

I will send you a shortlist of candidates.
Pick the candidate you would like to interview and respond to this email with their name and the role you have in mind.
I will schedule a 30-minute interview on Zoom or Google Meet between you and the candidate.
After the call, you can extend an offer letter.
The placement will be confirmed and the candidates start on the agreed-upon start date.

Sounds too good to be true?
Look us up here or let our interns vouch for us.


Do you prefer in-person interns?
We can help you there too!


Still not convinced?
Let's jump on a quick call this week and let me tell you more.


Let me know when you are available and I can schedule a call, alternatively, you can book a call with me by clicking here.


If this isn't relevant, let me know and you won't hear from me again.

a customer acquisition system but they don't have the time, expertise, or

Did you know that 70% of the global workforce consists of passive talent?

At ChatterWorks, we've figured out the secret to effectively connecting
with these passive candidates.

We started ChatterWorks because much of today's recruitment happens before
the application stage. That’s why we created tools like our Chrome
Extension that seamlessly integrates with LinkedIn and other social
networks, alongside a web platform that lets you search our database
directly.

Feel free to accept my invitation and try ChatterWorks.

Are you looking for different sustainable ways to grow revenue?

I run a performance based growth consulting firm that focuses on aggressive growth - out of the last 32 companies my partner worked with, 27 doubled their revenue within a year using his proprietary growth strategy.

For context, my partner has had 2 different 8-figure SaaS exits & I’ve personally done performance coaching for 8 & 9 figure executives.

I’d be more than happy to put together a custom growth plan based on your company for free before a possible conversation about working together.

Worth a chat?

bcc_email_sec_inbound,promotions@searchengineland.com,"This week's Search FYI is brought to you by: MNTN
Search — it’s been a key pillar in marketing strategies for as long as we can remember. But like all digital tools, the landscape doesn’t stop evolving. And between algorithm shifts and the cookie's impending demise, it’s becoming harder than ever to maintain the same paid search results. That’s why performance marketers are increasingly turning to Connected TV to get their desired results — and the reporting to prove it.

Join MNTN’s Eric Hatzenbuhler, Director of Performance Marketing, as he walks you through CTV’s capabilities and how it can get you the insights you need to further your brand’s performance marketing strategy.

After this session, you'll be able to:


	- Apply tips for adapting your search strategies to CTV
	- Find a reliable attribution model that works for you
	- Leverage CTV to amplify results on channels you’re already using

bcc_email_sec_inbound,mhowe@agcpartners.com,"AGC Partners             Dear friends and colleagues:  In an era marked by the convergence of digital transformation, increasing business complexity, and a proliferation of threats and regulations, GRC Software has emerged as a catalytic force in a fragmented and outdated marketplace.  Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) software is an integrated, holistic approach to manage organization-wide governance, risk management, and compliance with regulations. GRC tools ensure that an organization acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite, internal policies, and external regulations through the alignment of strategy, processes, technology, and people, with the goal of improving an organization's efficiency and effectiveness.  With the growing complexity of business operations and regulatory requirements, GRC Software has not only become a comprehensive digital solution used by global enterprises but has also permeated across several different sub-sectors through domain and vertical specific GRC applications. Deployed over the cloud, GRC Software offers real-time visibility into risk and compliance data, automates complex processes, and facilitates improved decision-making.  The primary function of GRC Software is to automate much of the work associated with the documentation and reporting of the risk management and compliance activities that are most closely associated with corporate governance and business objectives. GRC has quickly evolved from being managed with pen and paper or excel spreadsheets to AI-powered and integrated platforms which now provide a single pane of glass for managing risk and compliance measures across organizations of all sizes and locations. Key trends driving GRC Software demand include increased frequency of regulations, convergence of GRC and cybersecurity, explosion of data and data risks, growing need of real-time visibility into risk and compliance data, redistribution of risk management, increased business complexity, continued focus on EHS and ESG, and the global adoption of AI and ML for automation, giving rise to predictive analysis.  The global GRC Software market is currently valued at 49B (up 15% Y/Y), indicating a growing recognition of its importance in business operations. Despite this, many organizations continue to grapple with manual and siloed GRC activities that result in inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and regulatory noncompliance. Historical incumbents have dominated the market, with GRC being traditionally seen as ""back-office"" technology. Today, digital transformation and complex regulations have propelled GRC Software into an agile industry, with front-office functions actively participating in risk and compliance decision-making.  This has led to a highly fragmented industry, featuring large/growth players with broad GRC platforms, as well as domain and vertical specific solutions that automate specific GRC applications. The future of GRC lies in cloud-based platforms that deliver rapid and sustained value to all stakeholders by integrating and automating data with AI, while also providing differentiated risk and compliance expertise. GRC will ultimately evolve into a holistic, organization-wide process; siloed approaches or hybrid services will likely not succeed.  GRC M&amp;A deal volume hit an all-time high in '21 with 199 completed deals, a significant ramp from its pre-COVID levels. Activity remained healthy in '22, dipping only slightly despite macroeconomic headwinds slowing other tech deal making. Transactions came roaring back in '23 with an estimated $34B in total value the most notable of which being Nasdaq's acquisition of Adenza for $10.7B last June. This momentum has continued into '24, with a flurry of notable transactions including EQT's $3B acquisition of Avetta in April, Hg's backing of CUBE in March and subsequent add-on acquisition of Reg-Room in May, and Archer's purchase of Flisk in February. Most recently, though, has been Hg's acquisition of Auditboard, a leader in the GRC space, for $3B last week.  While the paradigm shift in GRC Software is still in its early stages, it has created significant opportunity for growth stage technology companies with disruptive GRC platforms to win market share and will lead to heightened M&amp;A activity as private equity and large strategics invest more heavily in the future of the space. With over 400 companies identified in AGC's GRC Software landscape across Broad Integrated GRC, Domain Specific, and Sector Specific GRC Vendors, the industry is large, rapidly growing, and multifaceted with vendors touching several different areas of the ecosystem.

Cybersecurity Ventures is producing a documentary on the fastest growing
and one of the greatest threats to humanity: Cybercrime, and the most
important things that we can do to protect against it: Security awareness
training (for the world's employees) and human risk management.

The documentary will be released on the last day of Cybersecurity Awareness
Month (CAM), Oct. 31, 2024. CAM was previously known as National
Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCAM) which was launched in Oct. 2004. This
year marks the 20th anniversary of CAM.

The documentary will feature various important and prominent figures in our
industry including F500 and large enterprise CISOs.

The documentary is made possible by our sponsors. Each sponsor is being
selected for their contributions to the industry via their products and/or
services, and for having a thought leader who brings the credibility and
media experience to be cast in the documentary - which may be a video clip,
sound bite, still photo with voiceover, or other.

Each sponsor will have credits and their logo at the beginning and end of
the documentary - and each person who appears in the documentary will also
be in the credits.

We expect the documentary to be somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, but we
won't know exactly until we are deep into editing it.

We are offering your company the opportunity to be one of the sponsors, and
to include one of your experts (who we approve of) in the documentary.

There will be a lot of ongoing promotion of the documentary after it is
released.

COST to sponsor is $12,000.

We begin production in June, and we are finalizing sponsors over the next
week.

Let me know if your company would like to be a sponsor.

Thank you.
-Steve

Yes, we could make them cheaper.
But if we did that, they'd be cheap.

They wouldn't convert as well as they should (8%* to 43%*)

They wouldn't be in your “Ideal Customer Profile”

better to follow up.

As I mentioned on Linkedin, I helped Nymity (now Trustarc) generate over
$11 Million USD in sales opprotunities prior to them getting aquired.

I was wondering if generating more deals for Jericho Security is a priority

We recently helped KeyFactor, a PKI company increase organic traffic but 35% MoM through the last 6 months utilizing a strategy of contextually relevant backlinks featuring callouts and features in publications like Forbes.

 Selling with no leads is tough, and most companies are experiencing a sudden drop in new leads that started in late 2023. Is that what Jericho Security is going through as well?

We might be able to help if that's the case. Being an appointment setting agency, we can set up a business development team to: Find potential clients for Jericho Security Reach out and introduce your value proposition Identify interested ones and book appointments with your team With offices in Canada and Europe, we can set up a team that can reach out to hundreds of prospects and book 1-4 appointments every week within a tight budget of 3-4k/month.

I sent you an email regarding an “Invitation-Only, Virtual Roundtable Discussion” that I'm finalising for a select group of senior Field Marketing, Demand Generation & Event executives.



Since my last email I have confirmed executives including:


 * Director of Event Marketing - Procore Technologies
 * Senior Director of Demand Generation - TeamViewer

Please see my previous message (below) for details on the topics.



When do have an AM slot this week (I'm based in the UK) to discuss the structure, topics, senior executives joining, networking aspects, answer any questions you may have and potentially extend an invitation?



Please let me know either way if this is of interest.

This is Dan Kenel - I reached out on Linkedin, but thought email might be
better to follow up.

As I mentioned on Linkedin, I helped Nymity (now Trustarc) generate over
$11 Million USD in sales opprotunities prior to them getting aquired.

I was wondering if generating more deals for Jericho Security is a priority
for you right now and if so, would you be open to a couple ideas we had for
you.

If so I'd love to quickly chat when your schedule allows.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,andrew@salesdevsn.com,"Hi Madison,
 So what do you think about having an appointment setting team for Jericho Security?
We can set up a team of 2-3 people within a very reasonable budget.
 This team will assess your ideal customer profile, find companies that fit, and reach out to them (via email, Linkedin, cold calls, etc.). They will do all the heavy lifting for your team to focus on discovery calls and closing deals.
 I understand that might sound very experimental for your business, but we did that for companies like CDS Cloud, Biovision DX, LiveChat, and others. We'd love to do that for Jericho Security as well.
 What do you think about a short discovery meeting?
Let me know what is a good time.

Subject: Appointment setting team | Jericho Security lead generation

 Hi Madison,
 Selling with no leads is tough, and most companies are experiencing a sudden drop in new leads that started in late 2023. Is that what Jericho Security is going through as well?

We might be able to help if that's the case. Being an appointment setting agency, we can set up a business development team to: Find potential clients for Jericho Security Reach out and introduce your value proposition Identify interested ones and book appointments with your team With offices in Canada and Europe, we can set up a team that can reach out to hundreds of prospects and book 1-4 appointments every week within a tight budget of 3-4k/month.
 Does it make sense for us to discuss that in more detail?
I would be glad to talk, just let me know what is a good time.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,predictablerevenue-newsletter@mail.beehiiv.com,"Good morning Sage,

Can I get your feedback on something?

I’ve spent the last few months writing and sharing the core content from the book and my shitty first draft is getting close to being ready! I’m at 38k words with a target of 45k.

The content of the book has shifted based on the feedback you all have shared and I am grateful for all your replies and conversations we’ve had.

I initially started out to write a sales book for founders, focusing on what I’ve learned first hand and seen our customers go through in trying to build their first revenue team. The original idea was to build the book around our new four funnels methodology (meet, disco, manage, nurture). As I talked to more and more of you, I learned that there were three things people were asking about most:

1. Finding product market fit

2. Stepping into a sales role

3. Building your first sales team

People wanted to know what the major milestones were, the tactics involved in each, and how to know when you’re ready to move to the next one. The content evolved to address these three pillars and as it did, the frame for the book shifted. So I’d like to share the new frame, title, and table of contents with you and get your feedback.

**Here’s the new table of contents: **

Introduction

Section 1: Find Product Market Fit 

* Why PMF comes first 

* How to find a big shift in the market

* How to find unmet needs

* How and why you need to quantify your PMF 

* Closing your first $1m is an act of product, not sales

* How to find your first 100 customers 

Section 2: Founder Led Sales

* When you’re doing something new, DIY first 

* Don’t whip out your deck (how to run discovery / selling v / closing)

* Stop trying to close! (start building a business case)  

* Sales habits that will make your life easier (next actions, call on a call, pipeline stages tied to customer verifiable outcomes) 

Section 3: Building Your First Revenue Team 

* Who to hire next and when

* How to be a sales leader 

* How to find your next 100 customers (How to scale demand generation channels)

* How to tie it all together (the four funnels)

**And finally, the updated positioning statement: **

Audience. 
I am writing for founders responsible for revenue and are terrified because they don’t come from sales and everyone is relying on them for growth.

Core message.
The better your product meets an unmet need, the easier your go-to-market will be. 

Promise.
I wrote this book to help founders see that unmet needs are the through line from product market fit, to founder led sales, and building their first revenue team. By the end of the book, I’ll share how I progress from one stage to the next, what it takes to be great at each, and where I’ve fucked up so you can make diff mistakes. 

I can’t promise that demand for your product exists, that you won’t run into roadblocks (you will), or that you won’t make a bad hire (you will and that’s ok). This book was created to help you see the bigger picture so you can figure out for yourself what to do next. 

It’s been a journey to get here and I’m not done yet, thanks for riding along.

What’s one thing you’d change and one thing you’d keep the same from what I’ve shared today?

THE UNEXPECTED TWIST: HOW WE GOT THERE:=========================================
The sweet spot where Spontaneity meets Emotional Regulation, and the whole thing becomes a beautiful symphony of Personal Identity! Let me take you on a journey with my friends at XYZ Inc. , who were struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of their manufacturing process. 
As the production manager, Rachel was frantically trying to keep tabs on every single order, from raw materials to finished goods. Her team was working around the clock, but mistakes kept creeping in, and delays started piling up. It was like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while running a marathon – you get the picture!
Enter Enterprise Automation, the unsung hero that swooped in to save the day! By implementing automation solutions, XYZ Inc. was able to streamline their processes, eliminate manual errors, and free up more time for their team to focus on high-value tasks. 
Fast-forward six months, and the numbers started speaking volumes: a whopping 35% reduction in production costs! That`s not just a nice-to-have; it`s a game-changer! The company was able to redirect those savings towards strategic initiatives, like R and D, marketing, or employee development – you name it!
But here`s the kicker: the actual cost-savings number is only half the story. The real victory came from the emotional and psychological benefits that came with this newfound efficiency. 
For Rachel and her team, the stress levels dropped significantly, allowing them to focus on the bigger picture. They started having more meaningful conversations about innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction – topics that had been put on the backburner for far too long!
The automation didn`t just save time; it saved sanity! As one of Rachel`s team members quipped, With Enterprise Automation, we`re no longer drowning in paperwork and manual tasks. We can finally take a deep breath and enjoy the ride!
Now, I know what you`re thinking: This all sounds great, but how does this translate to our company? Well, let me tell you – the numbers are impressive across comparable organizations within our industry. 
Take ABC Inc. , for instance, which saw a 27% reduction in production costs after implementing automation. Or DEF Inc. , where they achieved a whopping 42% decrease! These companies, just like XYZ Inc. , were able to redirect those savings towards initiatives that drive growth and innovation. 
The takeaway? Enterprise Automation is not just about saving money; it`s about freeing up your team to focus on what really matters – creating value for customers, driving innovation, and building a strong company culture. That`s the real treasure!
As I sit here writing this article, I can`t help but think of all the companies out there that are still struggling with manual processes. It`s like they`re stuck in quicksand, slowly sinking into a sea of inefficiency. 
But you don`t have to be one of them! By embracing Enterprise Automation, you`ll not only unlock significant cost savings but also unleash your team`s full potential. Trust me, the numbers will speak for themselves – and so will the smiles on your employees` faces!
So what are you waiting for? Dive into the world of Enterprise Automation, and get ready to reap the rewards!

THE APPROACH AND ITS SPECIFICS:===============================
Solution

As an Enterprise Automation expert, I`ve had the privilege of working with numerous organizations in the same industry as yours, and I`m happy to share some insights on the typical cost savings that companies like yours can expect after automating their processes. 

Industry Benchmarking

According to a recent study by Forrester Research, the average return on investment (ROI) for process automation initiatives in the [your industry] is approximately 30% within the first two years. This translates to an average cost savings of around $500,000 per year for companies with similar characteristics and size as yours. 

Key Findings

Our analysis of comparable organizations within your industry reveals some interesting trends:

1. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Automation: Companies that have successfully automated their manufacturing processes and supply chains have reported average cost savings of 25% to 30%. This translates to around $400,000 to $600,000 in annual savings. 
2. Business Process Automation: Organizations that have implemented process automation initiatives across various business functions, such as finance, HR, and sales, have experienced an average ROI of 20% to 25%, resulting in approximately $300,000 to $500,000 in annual cost savings. 
3. IT and Infrastructure Automation: Companies that have automated their IT and infrastructure operations have reported an average ROI of 25% to 30%, translating to around $400,000 to $600,000 in annual cost savings. 

Factors Influencing Cost Savings

While these benchmarks provide a general idea of the potential cost savings, it`s essential to consider various factors that can influence the actual ROI of your automation initiative. These include:

1. Industry-specific challenges: Your organization may face unique challenges or complexities that impact the effectiveness of automation. 
2. Automation scope and complexity: The more extensive and complex the automation effort, the higher the potential cost savings. 
3. Implementation quality and efficiency: A well-planned and executed automation implementation will generally yield better results than a rushed or poorly executed one. 

Conclusion

Based on industry benchmarks and our analysis of comparable organizations within your sector, companies like yours can expect to benefit from significant cost savings after automating their processes. The average ROI for process automation initiatives in the [your industry] is approximately 20% to 30%, translating to around $300,000 to $600,000 in annual cost savings.

""What are the most valuable things everyone should know?"" by Jordan B. Peterson.

Tell the truth.

Do not do things that you hate.

Act so that you can tell the truth about how you act.

Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.

If you have to choose, be the one who does things, instead of the one who is seen to do things.

Pay attention.

Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you need to know. Listen to them hard enough so that they will share it with you.

Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationships.

Be careful who you share good news with.

Be careful who you share bad news with.

Make at least one thing better every single place you go.

Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.

Do not allow yourself to become arrogant or resentful.

Try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.

Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.

If old memories still make you cry, write them down carefully and completely.

Maintain your connections with people.

Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or artistic achievement.

Treat yourself as if you were someone that you are responsible for helping.

Ask someone to do you a small favour, so that he or she can ask you to do one in the future.

Make friends with people who want the best for you.

Do not try to rescue someone who does not want to be rescued, and be very careful about rescuing someone who does.

Nothing well done is insignificant.

Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

Dress like the person you want to be.

Be precise in your speech.

Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

Don't avoid something frightening if it stands in your way -- and don't do unnecessarily dangerous things.

Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

Do not transform your wife into a maid.

Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.

Read something written by someone great.

Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.

Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.

Don't let bullies get away with it.

Write a letter to the government if you see something that needs fixing -- and propose a solution.

Remember that what you do not yet know is more important than what you already know.

Be grateful in spite of your suffering.

YOUR ORGANIZATION`S ENTIRE IT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A TICKING TIME BOMB WAITING TO IMPLODE DUE TO INADEQUATE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT.==========================================================================
The quest for reliable system configuration management. It`s a journey I`ve been on myself, as a former CISO at a mid-sized tech firm. Let me tell you, it wasn`t easy, but the lessons we learned along the way are invaluable. 
It all started when our company hit a growth spurt and our IT infrastructure couldn`t keep up. Our system configuration management processes were a mess – version updates were a nightmare to track, changes to software and hardware configurations were often lost in a sea of documentation, and audits? Forget about it. We were flying blind, relying on hope and prayer that nothing would go wrong. 
But then came the great audit of 2018. Our CEO asked me to lead an initiative to get our house in order, to guarantee the reliability of our system configuration management processes. I assembled a team of experts from across the organization, and we got to work. 
First, we standardized our version update process. We created a centralized hub for tracking changes, and implemented automated testing to ensure that updates didn`t break anything. It wasn`t sexy, but it was necessary. We had to be able to prove that our configurations were reliable, or risk losing the trust of our customers and investors. 
Next, we tackled the issue of change tracking. We developed a system for logging and auditing changes to software and hardware configurations. This allowed us to see exactly what had changed, when, and why. It was like having a digital paper trail – a valuable asset in any audit. 
Finally, we conducted regular audits to verify compliance with our established procedures. We created a schedule for these audits, and made sure that every department was on board. It wasn`t always easy, but it was essential. We had to be able to prove that our processes were working as intended, or risk facing the consequences of non-compliance. 
Throughout this process, I felt like we were playing a game of whack-a-mole – every time we`d squash one problem, another would pop up. But we persisted, and in the end, it was all worth it. 
As we implemented our new system configuration management processes, I thought about how much more reliable our infrastructure had become. I felt proud of what we had accomplished, knowing that we had taken a critical step towards ensuring the integrity of our systems. 
In hindsight, I realize that this process wasn`t just about complying with regulations or avoiding audits – it was about building trust with our stakeholders. It was about showing them that we were committed to doing things the right way, even when it got tough. 
So, how does our organization guarantee the reliability of its system configuration management processes? We standardized version updates, implemented change tracking and auditing, and conducted regular audits to verify compliance. And you know what? It`s working. Our systems are more reliable than ever, and we`re sleeping a lot better at night knowing that we`ve got this. 
This experience taught me the importance of having a robust system configuration management process in place. It`s not just about avoiding audits – it`s about building trust with your stakeholders, and ensuring the integrity of your systems. So, if you`re looking for a case study on how to guarantee the reliability of your system configuration management processes, look no further. This is the story of how we did it, and how you can do it too. 

THE APPROACH AND ITS SPECIFICS:===============================
Solution:

To guarantee the reliability of our system configuration management processes, our organization employs a multi-faceted approach that ensures the integrity, security, and consistency of all systems and their configurations. Here are the key mechanisms we use:

1. Version Control System (VCS):
- We utilize a robust VCS like Git or Subversion to manage version updates for all software and hardware configurations. 
- Each update is accompanied by a detailed description, timestamp, and author information, allowing us to track changes and maintain a complete audit trail. 
2. Configuration Management Tools:
- We use configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate the deployment, management, and versioning of system configurations. 
- These tools ensure that all systems are configured consistently and in accordance with our established procedures. 
3. Change Tracking and Auditing:
- All changes to software and hardware configurations are tracked using a centralized change management system. 
- This system records the reason for the change, the individual responsible for making the change, and the date and time of the change. 
- Regular audits are conducted to verify compliance with established procedures and to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. 
4. Regular Audits and Testing:
- We conduct regular audits to ensure that all system configurations are compliant with our established procedures and policies. 
- These audits include testing and verification of configuration management processes, as well as review of change logs and audit trails. 
5. Training and Awareness:
- All personnel involved in system configuration management receive comprehensive training on our configuration management processes and tools. 
- This ensures that everyone understands the importance of following established procedures and maintaining accurate records. 
6. Continuous Monitoring:
- We continuously monitor our system configurations for any changes or updates, ensuring that all systems remain compliant with our established procedures. 

Additional Measures:

To further ensure the reliability of our system configuration management processes, we:

1. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for personnel involved in configuration management. 
2. Implement a robust incident response process to address any issues or errors that may arise during system configuration management. 
3. Conduct regular security awareness training for all personnel to prevent insider threats. 
4. Engage in peer review and knowledge sharing among team members to ensure best practices are adopted and shared. 

By implementing these measures, we can be confident that our system configuration management processes are reliable, consistent, and compliant with established procedures, ensuring the integrity of our systems and the data they process.

One Month since Small Business Expo (NYC)

 

Dear Mohamad ,
Last month, we had a great time at the Small Business Expo (NYC)! Connecting with all the small businesses and hearing their stories was amazing. We want to thank everyone who came by our booth and took the time to meet with us.

At SuccessLink, we are proud to deliver comprehensive outsourcing solutions tailored to meet the diverse needs of businesses across various industries. While other outsourcing companies require a moderately high level of outsourcing seats, we support businesses of all sizes so that we can grow together - with no minimum seat requirements to start.

If you would like to learn about our services and how we collaborate with businesses, you can visit the link below. Want to contact us directly? Call us today at 888-276-1670.

Thanks again and we hope to see you at the next event.

Sincerely,
The Team at SuccessLink Outsourcing

Using LLMs cuts costs and boosts what you get back from your security spend. Please share with me how your company is planning to use these tools. Btw, did you know malicious open source packages, like the XZ-backdoor, rose by 1400% last year?

Best,

As I read about *Jericho Security*'s recent 3 million pre-seed funding to

bcc_email_sec_inbound,rise-with-rozenberg@mail.beehiiv.com,"Hey there, business trailblazers! Ready to unlock the secret sauce to deeply connect with your customers? Today, we're diving into one of the most powerful tools in your entrepreneurial toolkit: customer personas. Buckle up, because this is about to get transformative! 🚀

### Why You Need to Master Customer Personas

Imagine speaking directly to your audience's heart and soul, addressing their deepest desires and solving their most pressing challenges. Creating detailed customer personas can do just that. The reward? Higher engagement rates and more effective marketing campaigns that feel like magic. ✨

But here's the kicker: Despite the massive benefits, many businesses struggle to nail their customer personas. Why? Let's explore.

### Why So Many Get It Wrong

**The Main Reason**: Lack of Deep Dive
Many create shallow personas based on assumptions rather than real data.

**Other Reasons**:

* **Reason #1**: They skip customer surveys and interviews, relying on guesswork.

* **Reason #2**: They ignore data analysis, missing out on crucial trends.

* **Reason #3**: They create one-size-fits-all personas that don't reflect real-life diversity.

* **Reason #4**: They fail to update personas as customer behavior evolves.

Feeling overwhelmed? Don’t worry—we’re going to break it down step by step and show you how to create customer personas that truly resonate. Let’s go!

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Customer Personas

#### Step 1: Conduct Customer Surveys and Interviews 🎤

**Why It’s Crucial**: Real insights come from real conversations.

**Examples**:

* Schedule interviews with a diverse range of customers.

* Use surveys to gather data on their preferences, challenges, and behaviors.

_Pro Tip_: Use open-ended questions to get detailed responses. For example, ask ""What’s your biggest challenge in [your industry]?"" rather than ""Do you face challenges in [your industry]?""

**Quick Story**: Sarah, a small business owner, interviewed her top clients and discovered they all struggled with time management. She created a persona focusing on busy professionals and tailored her marketing to emphasize how her products save time. Her sales skyrocketed!

#### Step 2: Analyze Customer Data and Trends 📊

**Common Pitfall**: Ignoring valuable data.

**Examples**:

* Look at purchase history, website analytics, and social media interactions.

* Identify patterns and trends that reveal your customers’ behaviors and preferences.

_Pro Tip_: Use tools like Google Analytics and CRM software like our [RozenbergCRM.com](http://RozenbergCRM.com) to gather and analyze data efficiently.

**Why This Matters**: Many businesses overlook the goldmine of information right at their fingertips. By analyzing data, you can uncover hidden insights that shape your personas accurately.

#### Step 3: Develop and Document Your Personas 📝

**The Light at the End of the Tunnel**: Clarity and precision in your marketing efforts.

**Examples**:

* Create detailed profiles including demographics, psychographics, and behaviors.

* Give each persona a name and a story to bring them to life.

_Pro Tip_: Use templates to ensure consistency and detail in your personas.

**The Big Picture**: When you’ve completed these steps, you’ll have clear, actionable personas that guide your marketing strategies. This means more personalized campaigns, better customer engagement, and ultimately, higher conversion rates.

### Conclusion: Your Path to Marketing Mastery

Creating customer personas is your gateway to understanding and connecting with your audience on a deeper level. By conducting surveys and interviews, analyzing data, and developing detailed personas, you’ll transform your marketing efforts and watch your business soar. 🌟

**Your Action Plan**:

1. Schedule customer interviews this week.

2. Dive into your data analytics and identify key trends.

3. Create and document at least three detailed customer personas.

Hope you are doing well.

I apologize for the persistent follow-ups. I've been trying to schedule an introductory call with you.

Would it be possible for you to spare 15-20 minutes for a call sometime this week or next week? Your time is greatly appreciated.

If my outreach is misplaced, could you please direct me to the appropriate contact?

Have a great day 😊

bcc_email_sec_inbound,avi@angellistcapital.com,"Hey, Tim:


Just wondering — what does it currently cost to run your cap table?


I ask because most platforms (e.g. Carta) are over priced. They increase the
cost for every employee and investor you add to your cap table, and often aren't
up front about renewal conditions.


I’m Avi from AngelList and we do doing things differently that is easier on the
wallet.


By making the switch, most founders reduce cap table expenses by 50%, and our
pricing is fair + based on count of employees with options. (our product is
better, too).


Would you be interested in a quick chat in the next few days to discuss the
details? We’ll arrange the setup for you in just a few days.


Warm Regards,

About 500,000 at Risk in Christie's Breach
(via Bleeping Computer (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/christies-starts-notifying-clients-of-ransomhub-data-breach/) )

Christie's, a British auction house, is notifying individuals whose data was stolen in a recent network breach that was noticed on May 9th. After becoming aware of the breach, Christie's attempted to secure its network by hiring external cybersecurity experts to investigate the impact of the incident.

The RansomHub gang has claimed responsibility for the breach and is auctioning the data on its dark web leak portal. The data is purported to contain PII such as names, addresses, ID document information, and other sensitive information.

Hope this email finds you thriving in your business pursuits. I wanted to
circle back and shed light on a common pain point we all face – the
never-ending battle with accounting complexities.

Ever considered the immense value of outsourcing? Let me share some
eye-opening stats with you. According to a study by Clutch, 70% of
businesses experienced significant cost savings by outsourcing their
accounting needs. Another study by Xero found that businesses saved an
average of 11 hours per week by outsourcing bookkeeping.

Now, imagine those hours reclaimed for strategic business decisions rather
than crunching numbers.

Fusion Business Solutions Private Limited (FBSPL) is your ideal partner in
this transformative journey. Our diverse skillsets, flexibility with all
cloud-based accounting software, and custom automation solutions set us
apart. Imagine the peace of mind that comes with accurate financial records
and a team dedicated to optimizing your processes.

These differentiators aren't just promises – they're the backbone of our
commitment to simplifying your accounting.

Curious to explore how outsourcing with FBSPL can elevate your business?
Let's hop on a call to delve deeper into your unique needs and how our
tailored solutions can make a tangible difference.

Are you the right contact to speak to regarding security at Jericho
Security? If not, I would really appreciate it if you could point me in the
right direction.

I'd like to offer Jericho Security a couple of our AI powered cameras for a
month (at no cost, we'll even pay shipping both ways) -- our security
solution is designed to alleviate the day-to-day pain points of legacy
systems for end-users and reduce the total cost of ownership and
administrative overhead for key stakeholders.

If physical security doesn't pertain to you, my sincere apologies as I'm
still getting my bearings -- would you be able to help me get this offer to
the right person?

Best,

 Namespaces
 Let’s start with namespaces! Did you know we split them by default into web and background? Though, the real fun begins when you add your own.
 At AppSignal, we separated our API and Admin namespaces so we can have custom thresholds and notification settings for each.
 Anomaly detection
 Next, how about diving into anomaly detection to raise the alarm when something isn’t quite right? Set up triggers for those abnormal situations that need some investigation.
 You can set alerts for things like high error rates, low throughput, long queue times or out of control host metrics in any way you'd like (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc).
 Will you let me know if these were helpful or if you would like to stop the next emails with tips?

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to you as a follow-up to our previous conversation about your urgent need to fill the software engineer role at your organization.

As we discussed, this is a critical position for your team, and I believe I have several highly qualified candidates who would be a great fit. Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from you regarding scheduling interviews or moving forward with the hiring process.

As a growing telecom company with only an outbound sales strategy and a new 10x ARR goal, their new VP of Marketing knew he had to quickly build an inbound engine that would also win the trust of the sales team

And he did. Here's how Maurer shortened a 150-day sales cycle by 75%, with 400% ROI on pipeline generated, and how you can do it too.

Step 1: Define your audience

Maurer needed to reach companies with $50M - $1B in revenue from the financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare industries. Using that criterion, ViB identified a list of zLinq's ideal customers from our ViB Community, which is our millions-strong network of tech professionals.

How the ViB Community works (https://d2tb0Y04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/2N+113/d2tb0Y04/VXjBq74Qmxj0W5RRcVK80nHC8W8fXtNV5gqL0wN4zFKLR3pyd0W7lCdLW6lZ3nNW8k1n754pKp1qW7Ng3W97m4xLKW6WR7BY7rzt51W3FMPWm1LB5FmW7Xcrsl3Y-KjDW7FY4Wq7ST0l-W3j0s0Q4xFxBfW468tt7452JJgW26qyM_7wRYqdN3GJ47Nz2vspW4RcjwF6g1By3W5BbLZ_4P4CKBW1kXdm73_H9SQW4hblNH5kwPv8W1y23zN1jqCStW4gCMxd5xbfQ7W5rrPD942-5-xN8TqghcHQkyVVTnD596WD-znW4d4MB3636f-lVY1Fch1KCk9mVP5vWg6KCdttW3ygwSm545rGBW6443sY3-RT7vf6vMj-M04 )

Step 2: We pitch the solution

Next, ViB built a vendor-neutral landing page to promote zLinq's voice and data lifecycle management solution, specifically highlighting the pain points it would solve. This formula is how we attract only qualified prospects interested in the solution.

“The leads we received from the ViB Community matched our criteria exactly. They needed our solution to solve their voice and data management challenges. So they were immediately ready for a sales meeting,"" says Maurer.

Step 3: We generate demo-ready leads

Finally, by promoting the landing page to select Community members on our dedicated portal, ViB generated 15 appointments as part of zLinq's pilot Appointments campaign alone. ""We reached that target quickly,” says Maurer.

Hi Sage,


After going through the Jericho Security's website and LinkedIn page, it caught my attention that you are currently looking to expand your team with remote developers. Recognizing the potential synergy between our offerings and your requirements, I am reaching out to explore the possibility of collaborating with Jericho Security.


At Bacancy, we have a dedicated team of experts proficient in Java, Javascript, .Net, ROR, Ui/UX, Front end, Full stack, Data Engineering, Salesforce, and Dynamics 365. Our flexible engagement models, including Fixed Cost and Time & Material, are tailored to suit the unique needs of our clients. Additionally, we understand the importance of building trust in our partnership, and to that end, we offer a one-week free trial of a developer.


I am keen to discuss how we can align our resources to meet Jericho Security's development needs effectively. Could we please schedule a brief call at your earliest convenience to delve deeper into your requirements and explore potential collaboration? You can also book our meeting directly on my calendar - ""Mukesh's Calendar"".


I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further and demonstrate how our team can contribute to the success of Jericho Security.

Sure you get a ton of emails, and I definitely don't want to waste your

Hi Daniel,

Hope this email finds you thriving in your business pursuits. I wanted to
circle back and shed light on a common pain point we all face – the
never-ending battle with accounting complexities.

Ever considered the immense value of outsourcing? Let me share some
eye-opening stats with you. According to a study by Clutch, 70% of
businesses experienced significant cost savings by outsourcing their
accounting needs. Another study by Xero found that businesses saved an
average of 11 hours per week by outsourcing bookkeeping.

Now, imagine those hours reclaimed for strategic business decisions rather
than crunching numbers.

Fusion Business Solutions Private Limited (FBSPL) is your ideal partner in
this transformative journey. Our diverse skillsets, flexibility with all
cloud-based accounting software, and custom automation solutions set us
apart. Imagine the peace of mind that comes with accurate financial records
and a team dedicated to optimizing your processes.

These differentiators aren't just promises – they're the backbone of our
commitment to simplifying your accounting.

Curious to explore how outsourcing with FBSPL can elevate your business?
Let's hop on a call to delve deeper into your unique needs and how our
tailored solutions can make a tangible difference.

When will be a good time to connect?

bcc_email_sec_inbound,sarah.darlington@a8n-group.com,"Hi Sage - Over the last two years, companies have thrown more resources
than ever before into prospecting for new business - but is it working?
Working with a lead gen company is a little intimidating - empty promises,
a funnel full of bad leads, and no real accountability. We are different!

At Acceler8now, we have solutions that use intent data and email marketing
to capture the 3% of people when they are actively searching for solutions
like yours (or your competition!) - then we nurture the 97% until they are
ready to engage. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to consistently reach out
to them every day and capture them whilst they are actually looking?

Our solutions do that. Yes, we can provide you with huge lists of the right
type of contact in any company and send emails to them (and we do that
really well!) - but our intent data solution identifies people looking at
you, your competition, or for solutions like yours, and combines email
automation and human nurturing to stay with your prospects until they are
ready to engage. This is a new, living, breathing way to engage and
interact with hot prospects!.

A quick call is all I ask; it is a great option, we are pretty unique, and
we are cost-effective (way cheaper than Zoom Info) - but if you are already
working with them - we can help you consistently target their data too!

We specialize in prospecting. Every. Single. Day.

If this is intriguing, could we jump on a quick 15 mins call to see if our
thinking aligns? Worst case - we get to swap lead gen horror stories - I
love them.

Look forward to connecting,

Caption:

A seed was humbly planted at the start of the year and what grew from it _surpassed any expectations_ I may have had.

Fifty family members, traveling from all around the world, together for an extended weekend to **reunite across generations and geographies.**

We rented a venue and were together, under one roof, for the four day reunion. T Shirts were made with a family emblem, that was hand drawn and designed by one of the younger family members, inaugurated at this gathering. A videographer was hired for the entire weekend, not knowing what exactly he would be capturing, but knowing it would be worthy of capturing. A chef was hired to cook on-site for the group, _including the no less than_ twelve family members who had dietary allergies that needed to be catered for.

Baby photos were printed of all fifty family members participating in the reunion. Hanging on the wall, the black and white prints were numbered and we were asked to guess who’s who. I expected the older relatives, especially those who I’ve heard say for years _‘I was there when you were born’ _would be able to guess every photo. I was wrong. They struggled with a few, including a moment of comedy when a father didn’t recognize his own daughter’s baby photo.

A time capsule became a joint project. Photos were printed, from before I was born to ones of the reunion. Craft paper and felt tip pens were handed out and everyone wrote cards and letters, to their future selves and our family in the future. _It was decided we would open the time capsule ten years from now in 2034._

The highlight was skits. Prompts were written down by hand on scraps of paper, thrown into a bag, and groups of five to six people picked a prompt and were given a few minutes to develop and then act out a scene. **They were so bad that we could not stop laughing.** 

It occurred to me while watching my family members act out in made up scenes in front of an audience of fifty, so casually and calmly, that **we all really did feel secure and safe in this space**. It can be vulnerable, to speak let alone act, in front of a group this large. _Everyone did it with a smile and it seemed like, without breaking a sweat._

In the in-between moments, the family opted for playing cards, sitting and chatting, and of course, eating. The dining area seemed always full of people, with snacks in between meals and the food running out everytime. The chef had no idea how my family uses food as a **source of connection, entertainment and activity.**

Throughout the weekend, I found myself in 1-1 conversations with family members I don’t get to see or interact with regularly. With the familiarity of family, we would go deep really fast and I got to tap into people’s experiences on a variety of topics. Be it investing in the stock market, raising kids, charity work and more. **I appreciated the bank of knowledge available to me unfiltered and unfettered.** It has always been a real asset that I have come to rely on regularly.

For the last evening, we all dressed up. The toddlers in cute frocks and bowties, the women in dresses and the men in shirts and blazers. The sun started to shine through the clouds just as we stepped onto the terrace to take family photos. It took nearly one hour to capture the combinations of family, based on relation, location, generation and more. _And of course, everyone became an overnight director, which was fun to watch and maybe less fun for our photographer._

Later that evening, gag awards were given out, highlighting the memorable moments and inside jokes that made the reunion so special and fun. Followed by a full-on dance party, with everyone participating, regardless of age or ability. It was a magical moment to experience, in an environment that feels so safe and one where we all feel special.

On the last morning, we gathered blurry eyed after a late night, for one final group picture. As everyone said bye, I became teary eyed as I felt how special this experience was for me. **This group of people have shaped me, in ways I’m both aware of and will never be aware of.** I am who I am, how I am, for better or worse, thanks to this family that I grew up in. 

As we grow older, people move around the world, it becomes harder to feel connected to each other. It was grounding to feel connected to my roots, in such a loving and caring way. I feel so grateful for my family and these experiences remind me of how special this connection is in my life. 

And that is how I learned to family.

Let’s talk TV ads.
We asked marketers: 
What gives you the advertising “ick”?
The answers are in.
Who knew three simple questions could tell us where marketers’ heads are at? We were curious to learn why some ads turn people off — and what drives marketers to create more ads (or not).

The findings from this month’s poll have wrapped, and we’ve included a few from the full report below. Be sure to dive into the rest of the insights and see how your picks fared against your peers’.
Seeing the Same Ad Too Often Irks Advertisers:
The largest majority of our respondents said that “excessive repetition (ad fatigue)” turns them off. This was followed by “inauthenticity” and “it doesn’t resonate (aka bad audience targeting).”
When It Comes to Creating Ads, Budget Is the Top Concern.
If you’re a marketer — or really, if you’ve ever spoken to a marketer — this response likely isn’t surprising. Here’s how the top three rounded out (read the report to see the full list):

 Will you charge me later?
 No. Everything on Digital Ready is, and always will be, free.

 Do I need to be a Verizon customer?
 Also no. Anyone can register (for free) and learn (for free).

 Are you trying to sell me something?
 A third no. While Digital Ready members do get great offers,
 you never have to buy a thing.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,tina@10x-management.com," Hey Daniel,

If Jericho Security has taken a more cautious approach to hiring in light
of economic uncertainty but still wants to complete tasks and make
product/feature improvements, then the freelance talent market may be a
good place to start.

Here’s how 10x works:

   1. You tell us about a project or work that you need done or a role you
   are struggling to fill. We work best with one-off projects, specific
   deliverables, ongoing hourly work, part-time contracts, and full-time
   contingencies.
   2. 10x will consider your needs and the skills required, and ask any
   relevant questions about the project/role.
   3. 10x will immediately match the right tech freelancer/team from our
   exclusive, vetted roster to the position.

Would love to connect to discuss how 10x talent can boost your business.

Thanks,
Tina

Hi Daniel,

Hiring a full time software engineer can take 6 months or longer before the
new employee walks through the door. At 10x Management, we’ve placed
experienced, vetted freelance tech talent on various projects in as little
as 48 hours with forward-thinking companies.

There’s a reason we’ve been so successful for over a decade in the “renting
talent” space. We’re providing businesses immediate access to some of the
best contract tech talent in the world to move quickly and get work done.

I’d love to have a quick chat to discuss any potential needs/challenges you
might be addressing in case we’re able to help. Do you have 15 minutes this
week or early next to connect?

Thanks,
Tina

I've recently become an advisor for a cybersecurity tool named Jericho Security, which I believe could be service offerings for your clients. It features effective tools, such as a spear phishing simulator, training videos on demand, and email security solutions—a comprehensive package to address the growing number of cyber threats we see today.
I would like to introduce to you Sage Wohns CEO of Jericho Security. I feel it would be worthwhile for you and your team to have a brief demo for you to experience its capabilities firsthand with Sage and team. I think it could be highly advantageous for your team and something your clients could benefit from in their security portfolio.
If this is of interest, please let Sage know some availabilities, and they can arrange for a walkthrough of the solution.

If you filed for the employee retention tax credit program and you’re still waiting to be sent the checks, this could interest you.

The program is still paused, and it's difficult to know for sure when they’ll start paying claims again, leaving anyone that has filed in the last 6 months with a 1 year (or longer) wait time for checks.

If you are still waiting and would like get your money in two weeks, we are willing to purchase your claim for 75c on the dollar and we will wait out the eventual arrival of the employee retention tax credit refund.

So, we created an AI Tie-Out assistant (the first of its kind) that is

Applying generative AI to application modernization projects can accelerate agencies’ transformation journeys and spark a new era of efficiencies and service improvements. Scaling generative AI across the enterprise alone is challenging and moreso when you add federal security and transparency mandates.

There are MANY different ways that being a guest on a podcast can benefit
you. The obvious is tapping into a new audience that contains potential
clients, but have you thought about using podcast audiences to validate a
product or service? Or really work through how you describe what you do?

Here are some happy surprises we've heard from clients around their
experience with being a podcast guest:

   - Guesting on podcasts improved public speaking skills
   - Fine-tuned elevator pitch
   - Validated a new service offering
   - Landed VC money
   - Led quality candidates to apply for employment


We've found the best way to discuss the specific goals for your podcast
tour is with a quick call. Here's a link to my calendar

This past week we **celebrated our 300th issue** of this newsletter & to say ‘thank you’ replaced our typical weekly poll with a $300 gift card… that being said, without a specific topic to dive deep on we decided to instead **introduce two new concepts** to our ecosystem.

# Introducing our ‘Bootstrapping to Billions’ Podcast

We are looking to** host weekly interviews** and **community based** **‘ask me anything’ sessions** with game changers who are **building, buying, and investing in profit-led businesses** & can **help teach / train / equip us **something new to implement on **our own business journey**.

If you are **interested in being interviewed** or know of someone **who can share something of value** — let us know!

Youtube: ‘Bootstrapping to Billions’ (https://youtu.be/AKfsxtz2ZcU?si=fZN-ql_VwTilmsGz)

# Introducing our Community Capital Concept

One of the main reasons **WHY** we launched the [bootstrapper.community](http://bootstrapper.community) several months back was to help build **more meaningful relationships** with more** profit-led business owners** that we can invest in over at [BootstrapperCapital.com](http://BootstrapperCapital.com)

That being said, we are now looking to** explore a new community capital concept** that will help us get more folks involved with our mission of providing the most **affordable & flexible performance based capital **of choice for SMBs.

JERICHO SECURITY X NY WEEKLY

Hi Sage,

My name is Jessica, and I specialize in helping businesses like yours
get featured in top-tier publications.

We assist companies in building positive press, increasing brand
awareness, and enhancing customer trust through third-party
validations from prestigious publications.

These features not only provide SEO benefits but can also be leveraged
in marketing materials such as client presentations.

This month, we are partnering with NY Weekly to feature businesses
like yours.

The turnaround time is just 3 working days, and the cost is $297. This
includes a backlink and a comprehensive article about your business.

Are you interested in getting press for your business?

If so, reply to this email, and I'll share examples of our previous
work and the next steps.

Looking forward to your response!

Regards,
Jessica
