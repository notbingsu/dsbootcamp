We help tech scale ups reduce their new employee churn from 30% to 10% or less.

Hey Sage,

It’s been a while since we last got together. How’ve you been?

I’m reaching out because our CISO, Mark Sutton, was interested in what you’re building and wanted to learn more about the offering. I’m not sure if you’re onboarding new customers currently, but Mark leads our global security program (1500+ employees) as well as that of many of our companies’. Mark’s in town this week for RSA in case you are too and want to meet in person. Otherwise, I’ll let you guys chat over Zoom!

Dear Mohamad Iyan Danial,

Navigating supply chain risks and preempting problems ahead of time may seem straightforward in theory. But how do you implement best practices in reality?

Join FiscalNote Global Intelligence for a hands-on masterclass, where our specialists will workshop the mapping and forecasting of supply chain risks for a fictional company. During this simulation, they will follow a three-step process which you can implement in your own organisation. Watch as they:

Watch as our specialists:

- Analyse a map of the fictional company’s supply chain, demonstrating how to spot critical points of failure, fine-tune the map and differentiate between different types of risk
- Detect risk events in real-time, showing you how to do so even if you are not data-savvy
- Identify red flags for potential future risk, based on anomalous research patterns and changes in sentiment and trends

The masterclass will take place on Tuesday, 21 May, at 1100hrs Washington DC / 1600hrs London / 1700hrs Paris.

We look forward to you joining us. Please note that places are limited and preference will be given to clients of FiscalNote Global Intelligence companies, which comprise Dragonfly, Oxford Analytica and FrontierView.

Confirmation emails for the live session with unique joining details will come from updates@fiscalnote.com. Please ensure that this address is on your safe list to avoid confirmations being rejected as spam.

Yours,

In my review of Omdia's 2024 research agenda, there were a few research themes on our end that seem particularly relevant for you and your team. I'm reaching out to kick off a discussion regarding our planned research for 2024 in the context of your initiatives for the year.

I've been closely following Jericho Security's LinkedIn, its headcount and
the industry you operate. Am I wrong to assume that you might benefit from
implementing or accelerating some tech projects? Are you looking for tech
talent this quarter?

At BairesDev, we specialize in providing nearshore software outsourcing
services, powered by the top 1% of developers in Latin America. Our team is
not only highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also speak fluent
English and share the same time zone, ensuring seamless collaboration.

We've had the privilege of partnering with industry giants like Google,
Rolls-Royce, and Pinterest, but also with companies similar to yours,
delivering tailored solutions that have significantly boosted their growth.

We're confident that we can do the same for Jericho Security.

Here's what sets us apart:

   - Access to senior software engineers with an average of 10+ years of
   experience
   - Quick onboarding of top LATAM tech talent within 2-4 weeks
   - Award-winning, industry-leading software outsourcing services

I'd love to discuss how we can tailor our services to meet Jericho
Security's specific needs. Are you available for a quick 20-minute call to
explore this further?

Looking forward to your response, Daniel.

553,bcc_email_sec_inbound,founderhub@peachscore.com,"Hi Sage,

Great news! Your company has been pre-selected for Peachscore's accelerator, investment, and mentorship program for the next Cohort.

To give you a brief overview, Peachscore was established by a former partner and founding COO of Plug and Play (https://d2mdlx04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mdlx04/VWzKYC2T3bRVN5rrSDWyFJFWW70RWGB5fjTH5N3Lg88z3lcq-W7lCdLW6lZ3nbW5j1Dmz7HmNjHW4dMn6w2bK14rW5SZnDT3RGqwJW1ClsCy5b_HxCW3fq0_Z96ljrgW4rDfCM4BgbZzW1JH6354PkX34W86C-3w7k0NZ8W4sxmZq1pDRLDW58L4G583kXkwW8jTzxv8wdZ2xW8LxqbD7fkGYWW6cxQW07WcnLPW2SZGxm46t6x3W1JqLvR8KxWT4W4R8nHb2hZYz2W4b8GbN8l672wW2h5df63bPpZMW1BTRrg6zDMDrW3swgC337NjfzV-mqsh4t3zK8W87qBs33myrRzW34-__S1rt7GXW5Td0HM3xBGG6f3PdnWW04 ) and is supported by Plug and Play as a key shareholder. Peachscore's mission is to democratize access and help increase founders' chances of success through structured education, investment, and advisory programs. With our roots deeply planted in Silicon Valley, we provide programs for founders at the early stage, including the idea stage to Series A.

Peachscore was founded to address the challenges founders face in the startup ecosystem in gaining access to support. To understand the gravity of the problem, about 1M startups annually apply to accelerator-only programs, and only 18,000 startups worldwide have the chance to gain admission, leaving more than 98% of founders underserved and underrepresented.

At Peachscore, we are committed to helping you succeed if you are committed to doing the work. With over 100 years of combined founding team experience, we understand how vulnerable startups are in the first 24 months of their journey, and our mission is to mitigate your risk and significantly increase your chances of success by helping you with a framework to build a scalable venture and access to appropriate funding sources and advisors through these critical times.

Our program includes:

- A 12-week, data-driven accelerator program culminating in graduation and an online demo day.
- 1 year of support and access to the Peachscore ecosystem.
- Showcasing your company to the ecosystem of 300+ corporate executives, 100+ universities, 2k+ investors, and 40+ government agencies.
- Access to mentorship, office hours, and daily advisory sessions.
- Intensive learning, benchmarking your company against 600k other startups in the market, business intelligence, strategic growth, industry awareness, and in-depth platform recommendations.
- Access to a catalog of $2M in Perks offered by our partners.
- Exclusive pitching sessions and VIP event access.
- Chance to secure up to $500k in investment through Peachscore Capital and its partners.

Peachscore growth program is industry-agnostic, equity-free, online, and global.

604,bcc_email_sec_inbound,joe.moreno@retentionconsultingagencygroup.com,"Hi there Sage,

If you already filed for the ERC program and you’re still waiting, this could interest you.

Processing wasn’t restarted on Jan 1st as planned, and there’s little guidance as to when they will process claims again, leaving anyone that has filed in the last 6 months with a 1 year (or longer) wait time for checks.

If you are still waiting and would like get your money in two weeks, we are able to buy your claim for 75c on the dollar and we will wait out the eventual arrival of the ERC refund.

Would you be interested in this?

Great speaking with you and love hearing the positive news and results that you shared.

As mentioned,  here is the ICP info we used on the previous program.  I will update the company size to 1k-5k as discussed, any other changes you would like to make?


Campaign Details - Middle and Bottom of Funnel

Here is our ICP:

Industries: Finance, Healthcare & Pharma, Manufacturing, Retail, Utilities, Higher Education

Employee Count: 500 employees - 3,500 employees

Job Titles: CSO, CIO , Chief Risk Officer, Deputy CISO, Management Level: Manager, Director, VP of IT, VP Cyber Security, Director of Cyber Security, Global Security Awareness and Training Manager

Your previous program was for 150 leads for a total of $22,500.  Doubling this to 300 leads would still be the same CPL so the total would be $45,000.
It would be best to process paperwork ASAP so that we can have the leads flowing by the time your BDR / SDR bootcamp completes.
Please ping me with questions,
Chip

In case you missed it, I tried to get in touch with you several weeks ago
to check if there is a fit between Jericho Security and BairesDev
<https://www3.bairesdev.com/go?s=yTcdj0d28NZcOohYsuJhgn4Xvlh6Bxgf_zrRQBReGNR2vanMI-meWd6Suoxugd8gLI0cGhdvRvpbKes9lGcX1vPf8ctzaJz6lwZSNvtNq_7vrp5pt61kHwuwaYZ6o3OsPngks3g0iGJ3OpSFOamYCulgXAGzAzknByA-v6v24dRWeElC4UCqv8eA>
. I noticed one of our clients, Arup Banerjee from Windfall, is connected
to you on LinkedIn.

I have researched Jericho Security and sent some emails, so please let me
know if there is something else I can do to get a response. I'm sure that
BairesDev can be a game-changer for you and your team at Jericho Security.
We are a unique Software Outsourcing company that employs only the Top 1%
Software Engineers in Latin America (fluent in English and in sync with
your time zone). We have deep expertise across current leading platforms,
frameworks and programming languages, such as Salesforce.

We currently work with 500+ companies in different industries. In the Security
sector

we work with Netgear and Skeleton Key, among others.

Although it is hard to find free time slots these days, can we have a quick
chat so you can at least understand why I am so persistent? Let me know
your engineering needs and I will present our talented resources.
Hopefully, we can catch up soon and I can provide more details about our
highly competitive and unique approach.

If you work in a business, you’ve experienced the current state of the standard B2B go-to-market playbook.


Irrelevant offers.


Conflicting messages.


Spam.


Advertising that’s just noise.


Sales calls that ignore what the vendor ought to know about you.


Smart marketers and salespeople are doing stupid things to their customers and prospects every day. And buyers hate it.


If you want to be smarter, you need what I call Account Intelligence <https://click.demandbase.com/dc/K3f_Ii4nRPXdLVtFfrz0DIiJmH6UtVXyrylPyfgi-TeDfqgcSzf2zYTHx6qJweHEGolHAVE1DzNPhsBhVXwhMjL8L5SpCJaQQ3SGjALHp-8HPfnx5XKJXjOu0rT6aMD9VA2SKIwhRWy6qz_a8T4y2Voe5j0kvEzVYGjRkd04AoSRKMnBh_o2Ju-1744pHyxn_2w-PFo-XtWgUYUdM9RHAbNJLsWZC1rrybZ6LjZPghA1M7ZRyA4FNGWAFGvHUaaMGjUjF-puzwF99C289ZLRXQ==/Njk1LU5OTi00OTAAAAGTOxLpZ9jgq-lXDrl1AkY0if1DS3O9lyKr8Mv_Bx6-vfkoMkOnmXVLWi7DHYRB758zz-FnqRQ=>.


Account Intelligence fixes go-to-market fragmentation – data silos and disconnects across systems, teams, and processes – to enable your revenue team engage targets effectively.


By bringing together numerous buying signals from an account, enriching it with reliable third-party data, and making sense of it with AI, Account Intelligence enables Smarter Go-To-Market <https://click.demandbase.com/dc/K3f_Ii4nRPXdLVtFfrz0DIiJmH6UtVXyrylPyfgi-TeDfqgcSzf2zYTHx6qJweHEGolHAVE1DzNPhsBhVXwhMjL8L5SpCJaQQ3SGjALHp-8HPfnx5XKJXjOu0rT6aMD9VA2SKIwhRWy6qz_a8T4y2Voe5j0kvEzVYGjRkd04AoSRKMnBh_o2Ju-1744pHyxn_2w-PFo-XtWgUYUdM9RHAbNJLsWZC1rrybZ6LjZPghA1M7ZRyA4FNGWAFGvHUaaMGjUjF-puzwF99C289ZLRXQ==/Njk1LU5OTi00OTAAAAGTOxLpZ9jgq-lXDrl1AkY0if1DS3O9lyKr8Mv_Bx6-vfkoMkOnmXVLWi7DHYRB758zz-FnqRQ=> and helps B2B marketers and salespeople to:

Hi there,

Jericho Security and FiscalNote Global Intelligence are pleased to invite you to a webinar looking at how superpowers will adopt and use AI, and what this means for businesses.

This will take place on Tuesday, May 18, 2024, at 0800hrs Los Angeles / 1100hrs Washington DC / 1600hrs London / 1700hrs Paris / 2000hrs Dubai.

In this webinar – conducted with our friends at FiscalNote Global Intelligence – we will discuss the close connection between geopolitical events, actors, and AI threats. Superpower nations like the US and China are rapidly developing and adopting these technologies across multiple domains. These technologies are driving conflict and are used to disrupt businesses in ways that are not always immediately obvious. Many organizations struggle to adapt to the changing threat landscape. So how can businesses build up their resilience to state-powered cyber threats and how can defenders use AI tools to fend off these attacks?

We will cover:

- The evolving AI capabilities of state actors - How superpowers are already using AI and what’s coming next
- How these technologies are driving conflict - From deepfake election disinformation to AI-powered warfare
- The threats AI superpowers pose to businesses and what sectors are at most risk
- Top tips for building cyber resilience -  so your organization stays one step ahead of the hackers
- How you can use AI to boost your cyber defenses against AI-enabled threat actors

I recently reached out regarding our sales intelligence platform, but I
worry I may be contacting the wrong person. Time and again, studies find
that those who know their accounts, markets, and buyers consistently
outsell less informed competitors. Still, companies continue to have their
sales reps ask generic questions such as ""What keeps you up at night? What
challenges are you facing? Who do you currently use?"".

With primary-sourced insights into the world’s most complex buyers,
Emissary gives you a crystal ball on how to sell to your most desirable
customers.

Is there someone on your team that could benefit from this?

Madison,

If you´re evaluating SDR alternatives, we might be able to help each other.

We partner with tech companies to increase sales pipeline and grow revenue by delivering qualified at-bats for their sales team. We do this by providing dedicated outbound SDRs who set qualified meetings for your sales team via a multi-channel outreach approach including via phone, email, and LinkedIn . We have a deep bench of trained SDRs who are all based in the US, trained in-house, and ready to plug in to your outbound sales strategy.

With that said, let me take a step back here and ask - are you the best person to talk to about outbound lead generation?

Cheers,

Maya

1243,bcc_email_sec_inbound,paul@get-graphitefinancial.com,"Hi Daniel -- Paul here with Graphite. We
specialize in helping high-growth startups with their financial
operations.

Specifically, we often jump in when companies haven’t yet built
out a full finance function. I didn’t notice any finance titles @
Jericho Security... I’m guessing you’re attempting to handle the
finance efforts yourself? Or maybe with a solo team member or a
bookkeeping service?

We’ve seen too many founders and operators fly blind. Every
startup needs a full finance stack (even very early stage) to
understand the economics of their businesses.

With us, you’ll get a whole team of experts in different
disciplines when you need them, including CFO, controller,
accounting manager, etc. -- so you can focus on big picture areas
like growth and strategy.

Happy to connect if you'd like.

Let me know when you have some
time -- maybe on Tuesday?

I wanted to bump this because if you would like to use your anticipated refund now and not in the future this will interest you. 

We are willing to purchase your employee retention tax credit claim for 75c on the dollar, and you could get your money within two weeks.

If you’ve already gotten your employee retention tax credit refund just reply “received”.

Would you be interested in this?


Thanks,

I got a message yesterday about your life story. The person that submitted it indicated you have a story that might be really interesting.
I am a writer in New York, and I'd like to talk to you about putting this down into words.
I don't have full clarity on who submitted that material - was it you or someone in your network?
Do you have availability tomorrow for a 15 minute discussion?

Secure Access includes:

- Secure SSO
- Passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA
- Deep device risk insights
- Continuous authentication
- Robust third-party integrations
- Generative AI threat protection

I can’t wait for you to see what we’ve been working hard to deliver.

Hey there!

Everybody says “Leverage customer feedback to understand what they want and need.” But what exactly do they mean by feedback? Also, how do you gather it and where do you start?

Well, you're likely already familiar with direct and indirect methods of gathering feedback. So we're gonna talk about the third approach—inferred feedback.

Unlike the direct and indirect feedback, inferred feedback doesn’t come directly from customer comments or surveys. Instead, it involves analyzing user behavior on your website to gain insights into their satisfaction and preferences—without them saying a word.

Here’s how you can gather inferred feedback with:

2055,bcc_email_sec_inbound,joohoyeo@stanford.edu,"Hi Sage,

I had a great call with James yesterday. I'm trying to incorporate some of
his input into the whitepaper.
Given they have only used the Jericho product for one phishing campaign, I
think most of the quotes from him will be on the larger security problems
that he has seen in the industry. He also gave some feedback to about the
product, which I will document separately!

I'm hoping to have it for you guys by Tuesday after the long weekend. Can
we schedule a time next week for a final review?

Best,
JooHo",Re: James?

As the CEO & Founder of *Jericho Security*, you're no stranger to
innovating and staying ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving

kills most projects before they start (and how to solve it)…​How
to finish projects faster by using the Kinetic Kickoff (people
loved this)..​And the problem with generating demand and how to
Build Instant Demand using something most marketers are
completely overlooking (but the most successful brands use).​I
even walked through a practical example of building instant
demand for one company that resulted in 3.6X more applications
(without spending more money).​Plus, everyone shared some of
their favorite marketing tools.​I don’t normally share the
recording for the Marketing Leader Roundtable, but…​Everyone was
asking for it and I know these strategies will have a huge impact
for you.​​But first - an important update:​​We’ve filled all the

directors.​Inside, we help you simplify, systematize, and scale
your marketing…​By giving you everything you need to crush your
goals and advance your career.​And we do it by walking you
through the Marketing Director Roadmap…​So you always know your
right next step and have the training, coaching, and peer support
to make progress faster, get bigger results, and gain the skills
you need.​​If you want all the details, reply with “GROUP” and

*What happened:* On May 19, threat actor “Sumo” announced a data leak pertaining to a NATO school’s e-learning platform on the Russian-speaking deep web forum Cronos.
*Why it matters:* It is likely that the data breach originated from an SQL injection vulnerability that was privately advertised for sale on Telegram in January 2024. The vulnerability allegedly implicated an unknown NATO entity. It is very likely that the intended use of this data is social engineering and other fraudulent activity, with a likely chance it has already been leveraged in attacks by financially-motivated threat actors.

*What happened:* China linked cyber espionage threat actor Sharp Panda now being tracked as Sharp Dragon is now targeting Africa and Caribbean government agencies as well. Sharp Dragon is reportedly delivering the Soul modular malware framework which begins with the deployment of the SoulSearcher loader responsible for downloading, decrypting, and executing the Soul backdoor and its other components. This attack method allows the espionage group to gather more information.
*Why it matters:* According to reports, Sharp Dragon has so far confined their cyberespionage campaigns to South Asia, but recently it has upgraded their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gather sensitive data from government agencies and organizations in other countries. China threat actors broadening their attack surface and methodologies shows that they are expanding their cyberespionage campaign globally.

Google Fixes Eighth Actively Exploited Chrome Zero-Day This Year
*What happened:* Google recently issued an emergency security update about the eighth zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2024-5274, detected in its Chrome browser and has been confirmed to be actively exploited in the wild. Google has decided to retain certain information about this vulnerability till a majority of users implement the patch.
*Why it matters:* Google Chrome has over two billion users worldwide exposing many users to exploitation. Users are especially vulnerable as Google has acknowledged four zero-day vulnerabilities in May. Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because they pose an immediate threat to users' security and can lead to successful attacks on victims without any prior warning or time for mitigation.

hubspot.com is authorized to send on behalf of jerichosecurity.com, however it looks like SPF is still failing DMARC’s alignment test. DMARC looks at the Return-Path of a message to make sure the domain there matches the domain in your From address. If the Return-Path path doesn’t match your From address, those messages will fail DMARC’s SPF alignment test. Check with this source because you may need to set up a custom Return-Path.
Other sources These sources are sending emails saying they are from jerichosecurity.com, but we couldn’t verify that they belong to you. It’s important to go through each source and set up SPF and DKIM records for sources that you control. How to identify unknown sources How to fix SPF/DKIM records inkyphishfence.com

Forwarded email sources These sources might be from forwarded emails. The email headers are often preserved when emails are forwarded causing DKIM to pass and SPF to fail DMARC alignment because the From address no longer matches jerichosecurity.com’s SPF record. Generally, there’s nothing to worry about if you already have SPF and DKIM set up on your sources. Learn more about forwarded sources cloud-sec-av.com

I know this could sound a bit pushy, but I’d hate to give up on helping you.

Especially since I know we can help you scale your IT company (and I guarantee results).

So should I stay or should I go?

I’ve tried to reach you a few times but haven’t heard back which tells me 1 of 3 things:

● You’re all set and I should stop bothering you.
● You’re still interested but haven’t had the time or energy to get back to me yet.
● You’re just too busy right now. If so, simply reply with how many months I should wait before getting back in touch (fingers crossed the number is less than 100).

If you are busy, how can I stay in touch without being annoying?

If you aren’t interested, do I have your permission to close your file?

If you’re still interested, what do you recommend as the next step?

Thanks for your help,
Brian Hoppe,

If you don't want to hear from me again, reply with ""no thx"".

2676,bcc_email_sec_inbound,founderhub@peachscore.com,"Hi Sage,

Backed by 100+ years of cumulative research in venture capital, Peachscore was built to accelerate founders' success through the growth program. Startups can gain access to structured ongoing education, mentorship, networking, and potential investment opportunities similar to Y Combinator startups!

Startups are at high risk of failure in the first two years of their venture, and the right education and mentorship, along with meeting the right investors, play a crucial role in establishing a solid company.

Where can founders access all these resources in one place? The answer is accelerator programs. Unfortunately, out of 1.6 million annual startup applicants to accelerators, only 18,000 gain admission worldwide. This means that over 99% of founders are underserved and overlooked, leading to wasted time and missed visibility.

At Peachscore, we prioritize minimizing risk for founders. As analyzed by TechCrunch, the chance of startups graduating from an accelerator program increases by 50% to secure their Series A financing.

Explore how Peachscore supports startups in this short video.

Frequently Asked Questions

I have purchased some user seats previously as one-time purchases. Will those seats be converted to a subscription?

No, those seats will not be converted to subscriptions. All previously purchased seats will still work as a one-time purchase and will be valid forever. The new pricing is only for new purchases.

If I buy new seats now, will it be a one-time purchase or a subscription?

If you buy new seats before 6th July 2024, there is an option to buy as one-time purchase (you will see the option in the checkout screen). You can choose to pay the new subscription price if you want to but it's not required.

If I buy new seats after 6th July 2024, can I pay the old price as a one-time purchase?

No. After 6th July 2024, all new seat purchases will be subscriptions.

Does this pricing change affect customers who are using the self-host version?

Yes, and the same policy applies: all existing purchases will continue to be charged at the old pricing. The new pricing will only affect new purchases.

I'm currently on the Starter plan, will my account get limited to 3 AI agents and 3 plugins now?

No. If you are already on a plan, the changes will not affect your current subscription. You get unlimeted AI agents and plugins in your account. The new limits will only apply to new purchases.

If I subscribe to the Growth plan now, will I get the old limits or the new limits?

If you subscribe before 6th July 2024, you will get the old limits. The new limits will only apply to new purchases after 6th July 2024.

Why are you changing the seat license to subscription now?

The one-time purchase seat license was offered as a limited-time promotion as a token of appreciation to our early customers. We are now making these changes to ensure our long-term sustainability so that we can better serve our customers. Every new user to the platform increases our costs: servers, database storage, bandwidth, customer support, and more. The subscription model will help us cover these costs and continue to provide a great service for all of our customers while keeping the platform up-to-date with the latest developments in the fast-moving AI space.

Do you offer volume discounts for large purchases?

Yes. Please contact us at support@typingmind.com for a quote.

I'd like to test the waters for a potential technical partnership between
our companies.

With Superior Technologies, Jericho Security can create stable, scalable,
high-performance, and well-documented software systems. Our rates are
highly competitive compared to other American-based companies, and we have
significantly higher skill levels than offshore outsourcing firms.

Service Express, Bosch Automotive, and Corewell Health have chosen us as
their tech partner, and we're enthusiastic about bringing value to Jericho
Security as well.

Would you be available for a conversation next Tuesday or Wednesday if I
piqued your interest?

Best,
Eva

We just had a call with Ya-Rong. Her feedback for the new offer is
positive, as she found it quite attractive, so after some consideration,
she decided to accept it and she will resign after receiving the official
offer letter from T1.

The only potential risk we anticipate would be her current company try to
retain her with a higher salary or guilt trip her. Hence we've also tried
our best to prepare her on how to handle the possible scenarios. (We asked
her to not share the new offer amount to avoid conter-offer from her
current company, and asked her to make it as clear as possible to her
manager that she has made up her mind and hopes for nothing but their
blessing)
After she receives the offer letter, we will also closely monitor her
status throughout the resignation process and keep you posted.

We will prepare the updated offer letter ASAP, could you kindly confirm
whether the attached is all correct before I send it out to Ya-Rong?

Hi Mohamad Iyan Danial,

Since the arrest of then-President Pedro Castillo on 7 December 2022, Peru has been beset by civil unrest.

Last year, our client wanted to know whether it would be safe for them to hold a major festival in the country in 2024. Would some locations be riskier than others? What was the probability that the protests would still be ongoing, and how disruptive might they prove to the festival?

To answer such questions, which were part of their long-term planning process, a general view of the geopolitical situation was not enough. The organisation needed a customised view of the risks and implications for their specific situation.

That’s where FiscalNote Global Intelligence Advisory services help.

BOOK A CONSULTATION: https://pages.fiscalnote.com/Advisory-Enquiry.html

Whether you are organising an event, entering or exiting a new market, launching a new product or considering any other kind of change, we can create scenarios looking at how a specific geopolitical flashpoint might develop.

These are bespoke to you, based on a set of assumptions that are unique to your organisation and take into account your business model, goals and strategies.

As our client with the Peru event found, the result is to make your planning process more focused and effective, with a narrow set of concrete scenarios to discuss rather than a multitude of hazy possibilities. It’s more proactive, too, as you can initiate conversations with senior decision-makers about how they might respond should some of the more alarming scenarios come to pass.

If that’s the kind of long-term planning process you want as well, please get in touch with our specialists today.

Best regards,

Cvete Koneska

Sorry to bother you again, but I am unsure if you received my first email.

While we take a giant leap to a digital-only world, engaging videos will be
critical for Agolo

Companies like Fujitsu and Lenovo hire us to handcraft animated videos that
would:

1. Distill their complex ideas into digestible content.
2. Highlight the key value proposition to their prospects.
3. Help them stand out from the competition.
4. Help them emotionally connect with their audience.
5. Build brand trust and enable the sales team.

Sage, we are excited to be in conversation with you and look forward to
discussing how we have been helping companies like Agolo to tell great
stories.

Can we connect over a quick call? Lmk.

Keep telling great stories,

CFO’s New Approach to KPIs
Tuesday, May 28 | 11:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. PT
On their own, KPIs don’t always tell the story of where your organization needs to go and how to get there. To get the desired outcome, the context and behavioral motivation—targets and incentives—are often as critical as the KPI metric itself. Used in connection with effective OKRs (Objective Key Results), targets and incentives have the power to drive extraordinary achievement when designed correctly.
Join us for a discussion with Bernie Smith, author of “GAMED: Why Targets and Incentives Fail and How to Fix Them” as we explore practical examples and case studies, shedding light on the essential steps for designing robust, effective, and credible targets and incentives for organizations.

We connected last year with Amy on Jericho’s demand-gen support needs.

Any Q3/Q4 projects that are hot, going un-addressed, or stressing you out?

Dena and myself, along with our 350+ consultants across all marketing disciplines, are at your service – btw: we have folks with experience in cybersecurity as well as performance and customer strategy.


  *   Would discussing a challenge to determine the best approach be helpful?
  *   Does a curated team solving a project with efficient expertise sound good?

Whatever you need, we’re here for you.

Let me know if a chat is in order.
Or, book some time here<https://calendly.com/d/ytgx-ww5j/meet-with-area-of-expertise> if that’s more convenient.


Keep winning,
Jim

Most conversations around Identity Resilience focus on the prevention of attacks. But as statistics increasingly show that a major breach is a matter of “when”, not “if”, CISOs are realizing that their Identity Resilience strategy is missing a critical piece: response.

I hope you're doing well.
I'll get straight to the point because I don't want to waste your time.
Here is why you shouldn't let me sit in your inbox:We save you time by hand-picking profiles for Jericho Security after assessing over 500 candidates.These remote interns will work for Jericho Security for 40 hours a week and take a monthly stipend of only $800 - $1000.There is zero recruitment cost to you, as the candidate is our customer and not the employer.All of our candidates are Multilingual.Our collaboration would save you time and money in exchange for brilliant young talent that could potentially become permanent future hires - everyone wins!The next steps are straightforward.I will send you a shortlist of candidates.Pick the candidate you would like to interview and respond to this email with their name and the role you have in mind.I will schedule a 30-minute interview on Zoom or Google Meet between you and the candidate.After the call, you can extend an offer letter.The placement will be confirmed and the candidates start on the agreed-upon start date.Sounds too good to be true?Look us up here or let our interns vouch for us.
Do you prefer in-person interns?We can help you there too!
Still not convinced?Let's jump on a quick call this week and let me tell you more.
Let me know when you are available and I can schedule a call, alternatively, you can book a call with me by clicking here.
If this isn't relevant, let me know and you won't hear from me again. 
Kind Regards,  Mandri

- In the Kixie PowerCall Chrome extension, agents will be auto-prompted to install PowerCall Version 2.34.0. They can also force the update themselves via PowerCall Settings → App Update.

Highlighted Features and Enhancements

Schedule a Call Task when PowerDialing

- When PowerDialing, your agents can now schedule a call task that logs to the CRM (and their CRM-connected calendar if enabled).

Pause/Unpause Recordings

- Agents can now easily Pause and Unpause Call Recordings during a call, allowing them to prevent sensitive data from being recorded.

Hubspot Enhancements:

- After re-connecting your Kixie PowerCall to HubSpot (https://d2qCdQ04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/UB+113/d2qCdQ04/VVQdSq95rcb2W7JrMH29c-k1NW3hB9jJ5fKshBN7-7xzY3pyd0W95jsWP6lZ3pRW4Hdnd11M-VFZW3YTFb55fvGnzN5BBgVTPL3vmMNNRZpZdHygW3W8FQN7W-p6kW1xycdq8tpZgvV4JqVY5WMzbGW3qcwcV80DCXvVGFwP-3-FHh8W5Tb0Z04t4N3XW4X0GKf5LlHFJW1fXNjV5FwrvxW5xY64h5QtjK9W4xRhMS6lQnBwW2ty6px6l84ncW77w_BC9fht44W7HBV369lFQxgW2Xk6X17bF8YwW4Q4ZY_1ljR1zW59VHVs5g9vsHW5sfLMB3QwBqYW2nzpD23_Cb6_W2DtgMB5h841WV8-c9X4ZF_phW333JHy1nCPvNW22Q5Dq4ct9kgW62j_r71lFrm1N44nB5n-CdDXW7dg2XV96fWq4W2qdznC4T3ZSvf3zPt1q04 ) , you'll be able to directly import a HubSpot contact list into a PowerList, eliminating the need to export/import. Active lists will be imported statically.
- Under Account Settings -> CRM Properties, you can now declare custom phone fields as ""Phone"" properties, and Kixie will then integrate activities with those custom HubSpot phone fields.

Transfer/Conference Enhancements

- Agents can now retrieve Held Calls that were previously lost when the agent's internet connection was temporarily severed or the agent reloaded PowerCall, preventing parties from becoming stuck on hold.
- Agents now receive an in-app notification saying ""Party Has Left The call"" when a caller on hold hangs up.

Assign CRM Contact Owner On PowerList Disposition

- You can now use a PowerList Disposition rule to assign the agent as the CRM contact owner. For example, ""Appointment Set"" can remove the contact from the PowerList AND make the setter the CRM contact owner.

Recently Added Features and Enhancements

Speed to Lead ""Highest-Priority"" PowerLists (https://d2qCdQ04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/UB+113/d2qCdQ04/VVQdSq95rcb2W7JrMH29c-k1NW3hB9jJ5fKshBN7-7xzF3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3nfW8h2yF16mQ-2_W8KzBfy9d0FPFW1XmrtY7BWLwdVN63Rj9lsrDlW9dqtYs4mmHs1VfWt778nHWzTW5GXFFz2yHzqfW4vv3JH1cymm6W5hKsLw2NrQTnW1d_sMt7FTTT0VY1pJV6F_6R5W7Yxf8L3-LB8xW8tGLBv7V9S4VW4qxbCr4R9xkbN8sJ-R3pMwLZVj5N7f7TmjGdW3_4sQN4MvL7FW1Swj6K7g2c5TW6NL5_x4qwj2rW3c84DP63JxK9W5MsWZb7_hdLWW1mn8rX6JnzSZW46X7j383Y8KvVrC2_K4FVWkfV9gv4588rny7F4SJhgkJpnZW9gz4lm9bFpZQW9gH_q97Q90RZf34GqHM04 )

- You can use the ""Add Contact to PowerList"" action to send hot leads into a 'Highest' Priority PowerList to ensure that they will be served up to your agents as their next PowerDial.
- You can create a speed-to-lead + continuous followup system by automatically forwarding your contacts from higher-priority PowerLists to lower-priority PowerLists after completing a certain number of dial attempts.

CRM Properties

- In Manage -> Account Settings, you can sync contact properties over from your CRM, and select specific properties for your agents to use in their Kixie SMS templates.

So, would you like to get the list of Darktrace customers with contract expiration dates?

We can also help you with a similar user list of LogRhythm, PingIdntity, Proofpoint and Sophos, SailPoint, Palo Alto, CyberArk, Fortinet, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne, among other cybersecurity vendors.

Please let us know if you're interested so we can share the counts, pricing, and further details as a next step.

Hey rockstar,

We released our first product eight months ago, allowing anyone to make a song with just a simple idea. 12 million of you have now made music with Suno, and we have been deeply inspired by the songs you have created. We've seen friends exchanging memes, couples trading love songs and streamers co-creating songs with stadium-sized audiences. Some make songs for others, while others play, explore and make songs for themselves.

We are very excited to announce that throughout the remainder of 2024, we will be paying a total of $1 million to these creators who are bringing us closer to music, and each other, with Suno. We are kicking things off with the Summer of Suno, a celebration of the songs that move us as a community — whether they make us bob our heads, tap our feet, laugh, cry or simply say ""wow.""

The Summer of Suno (SoS), Vol. 1 starts tomorrow on Saturday, June 1st. We are paying out the first $100,000 of the total $1 million prize pool to the creators of the top 500 songs made with Suno during the month of June. All public songs will be automatically enrolled in SoS Vol. 1, and song rank will be determined by plays, likes and shares. 

 

We can't wait to see what you make.

Dear Valued Customer,

 We are reaching out to inform you of an important update related to our billing practices, specifically regarding the collection of sales tax. In line with evolving tax regulations and our commitment to compliance, we will begin collecting sales tax on transactions in states where our services are considered taxable. This change reflects our dedication to adhering to state tax laws and regulations, ensuring that we continue to provide you with high-quality service while meeting our legal obligations.

 What This Means for You:
 Starting from July 1, 2024, sales tax will be applied to your subscription fees as you are located in one of the states where Software as a Service is considered taxable.

 Please note that the applicable sales tax rate will vary by state and locality. This additional charge will be reflected on your invoice, and you will be able to view the detailed tax calculations for full transparency.

 No Action Required:
 There is no immediate action required on your part. Our billing system will automatically update to include the necessary sales tax for your next billing cycle. We recommend reviewing your billing address to ensure accuracy and prevent any potential billing discrepancies.

 Our Commitment:
 At Docker, we continually strive to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements, ensuring we deliver exceptional service while maintaining transparency with our valued customers.

 We understand that changes in billing
can be concerning. Please rest assured that we are committed to making this transition seamless. Our team is here to support you and answer any questions you may have regarding this update.

 For further information or any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support team at hub.docker.com/support/contact <https://em.docker.com/NzkwLVNTQi0zNzUAAAGTbxKsuBAO-p18TmpQKqmiEUwf5CKtwuKzg9B1h1sFrdLafSHTP3K0IlZk6bxwRiwsb5sUHUQ=>. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we make these necessary adjustments to comply with state tax laws.

4605,bcc_email_sec_inbound,mike@wingspansolutions.net,"Hi Brian,

I wanted to follow-up and add a little more detail.

In anticipation of the candidate's start on Tuesday, May 27, I was in
contact with him on Friday, May 24, and he let me know that although having
received approval for his OPT on his F-1 Visa, he would still need his
Employment Authorization Document (EAD), so I did message the Jericho team
on Slack on May 24 that he would not be able to start on Tuesday, May 27. I
think this is where communications started breaking down. On Tuesday, Grace
would have been onboarding him, but I received messages in the morning that
the candidate was not responding, and I shared the information about the
delayed start again due to the lack of the EAD card. I was in contact with
the candidate Tuesday evening to verify if the EAD had arrived or not, and
he confirmed that it had not been received, and said he would reach out
when he did receive it.

I think the candidate's mistake was that he was only responding to me
despite the Jericho team directly contacting him on multiple avenues, until
yesterday when he was presented with an ultimatum to directly respond to
the Jericho team or face rescission of his offer letter. He did respond to
the Jericho team with a rather tone-deaf email complaining about interteam
communications, but also providing a status update on the arrival of his
EAD.

For context, I am a contractor working with Jericho and am helping them
facilitate their hiring, so that is my role in this and why I have been a
middle-man.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Mike

Hi Chris, yes, we can certainly meet your lead profile criteria. Given
titles are sometimes slightly modified company-to-company can we also
generate leads from similar types of titles? if so, would you like me to
send over an SOW for you to review? How many leads would you like me to
include in the SOW? I look forward to hearing from you. Best, Joan

THE UNEXPECTED TWIST: HOW WE GOT THERE:=========================================
The quest for the holy grail of automation. It`s a journey I`ve been on myself, with twists and turns that would make even the most seasoned navigator pause. But fear not, dear reader, for I shall regale you with tales of triumph and tribulation, garnered from my own experiences in the trenches of Enterprise Automation. 
In our organization, the quest began with a clear vision: to integrate multiple systems, processes, and stakeholders to optimize business outcomes and improve operational efficiency. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, let me tell you, it`s not as straightforward as it seems. The path was riddled with obstacles, missteps, and downright frustrations. 
The first hurdle we encountered was the sheer complexity of our existing infrastructure. A tangled web of disparate systems, processes, and data formats, each with its own set of quirks and idiosyncrasies. It was like trying to build a house on shaky ground – you can`t just start hammering away without a solid foundation. 
So, we took a step back, assessed the landscape, and charted our course. We identified key stakeholders, mapped out our processes, and developed a comprehensive strategy for integration. Ah, but then came the inevitable challenge: change management. Resistance to change is like trying to move a stubborn boulder – it takes persistence, patience, and a healthy dose of creativity. 
One memorable moment was when we introduced an automated workflow tool to streamline a particularly convoluted process. The initial response from our team members was, shall we say, less than enthusiastic. Why fix what ain`t broke? they`d say. But we persisted, armed with data-driven insights and compelling business cases. Slowly but surely, the tide began to shift, as employees saw the benefits of automation firsthand. 
As we navigated this choppy waters, I couldn`t help but wonder: What`s the secret sauce behind successful Enterprise Automation? After all, it`s not just about slapping together a few tools and calling it a day. No, no – it requires a deep understanding of human psychology, organizational dynamics, and technological wizardry. 
Here are some actionable steps that have worked for us:
1. Start small: Don`t try to boil the ocean in one go. Start with a narrow focus area, demonstrate success, and then scale up. 2. Involve stakeholders: Listen to their concerns, address their fears, and empower them to drive change. 3. Map your processes: Identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement. 4. Develop a comprehensive strategy: Integrate technology, people, and processes to achieve optimal outcomes. 5. Monitor and adjust: Continuously track progress, refine your approach, and adapt to changing circumstances. 
Throughout this journey, I`ve come to realize that Enterprise Automation is not just about technology – it`s about people, process, and culture. It`s about creating a harmonious symphony of automation, where each component plays its part in harmony. 
As we look back on our odyssey, I`m struck by the wisdom of an old friend: The only constant is change. In today`s fast-paced, ever-evolving business landscape, Enterprise Automation is not just a nice-to-have – it`s a must-have. And if you`re willing to put in the effort, take calculated risks, and stay flexible, I reckon you`ll find yourself sailing into calmer waters, with a treasure trove of benefits waiting at the horizon. 
So, go forth, dear reader, and chart your own course. May the winds of change guide you, and may your Enterprise Automation journey be filled with triumphs and tales to tell!

ZeroFox Intelligence Brief - Dark Web Competition Offers Insight into Threat Actor Focus
*What happened:* The results of competition “// XSSware” on Russian-speaking dark web forum “XSS” were announced on April 16. Projects focusing on obfuscation performed well, likely indicating a demand for accessible, free obfuscation tools within the threat actor community.
*Why it matters:* While the direct impact is very likely limited, the competition and winning projects will likely contribute to increasing efficiency in attack vectors, particularly as the projects are free to access by members of the forum. The top three projects have predominantly been awarded due to their perceived potential rather than their immediate application—with the exception of the first place PowerShell Stealer, which allegedly boasts immediate application. It is very likely that the total prize money of USD 20,000 awarded in the course of competition “// XSSware” will further fund threat actors in developing their malicious tools.

May 28, 2024
Pakistani Hackers Target Indian Critical Infrastructure
*What happened:* Cybersecurity researchers have discovered Pakistani APT group Transparent Tribe targeting the Indian government, defense, and aerospace sectors in a spear phishing campaign with cross-platform malware written in Python, Golang, and Rust.
*Why it matters:* Transparent Tribe is persistently targeting critical sectors vital to India's national security. The group's evolving tactics include cross-platform programming, open-source tools, and web services. Its actions and targets align with escalating India-Pakistan geopolitical tensions, suggesting a strategic motive. Threats from malicious cyber actors, such as Transparent Tribe, will likely persist and heighten amid the ongoing Indian general elections.

1.3 TB of Data Belonging to TicketMaster for Sale on BreachForums
*What happened:* On May 28, ZeroFox Intelligence observed threat actor ShinyHunters selling 1.3 TB of data, allegedly belonging to Live Nation Entertainment, the owner of ticket-selling platform Ticketmaster. The BreachForums post claims that the leaked data contains information about 560 million users, including names, addresses, email IDs, phone numbers, and credit card details. The threat actor has priced the database at USD 500,000.
*Why it matters:* ShinyHunters was one of the two administrators of BreachForums before Law Enforcement took the dark web marketplace down last week. The alleged Ticketmaster data breach is yet another indication that BreachForums is steadily being revived. Moreover, the leaked data can expose customer data to extortion scams, spear phishing attacks, and malicious actors. Besides, Live Nation Entertainment is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice because of its allegedly anti-competitive business practices and ""monopolistic control over the live events industry."" TicketMaster is likely to lose more credibility if the investigations prove that threat actors did breach its systems to steal customer data.

I'll get straight to the point because I don't want to waste your time.


Here is why you shouldn't let me sit in your inbox:

We save you time by hand-picking profiles for Jericho Security after assessing over 500 candidates.
These remote interns will work for Jericho Security for 40 hours a week and take a monthly stipend of only $800 - $1000.
There is zero recruitment cost to you, as the candidate is our customer and not the employer.
All of our candidates are Multilingual.
Our collaboration would save you time and money in exchange for brilliant young talent that could potentially become permanent future hires - everyone wins!

The next steps are straightforward.

I will send you a shortlist of candidates.
Pick the candidate you would like to interview and respond to this email with their name and the role you have in mind.
I will schedule a 30-minute interview on Zoom or Google Meet between you and the candidate.
After the call, you can extend an offer letter.
The placement will be confirmed and the candidates start on the agreed-upon start date.

Sounds too good to be true?
Look us up here or let our interns vouch for us.


Do you prefer in-person interns?
We can help you there too!


Still not convinced?
Let's jump on a quick call this week and let me tell you more.


Let me know when you are available and I can schedule a call, alternatively, you can book a call with me by clicking here.


If this isn't relevant, let me know and you won't hear from me again. 


Kind Regards,  
Mandri

4949,bcc_email_sec_inbound,taylor@thedemandgen.co,"Daniel - when I speak with CTO s', they often tell me about their revenue
pipeline challenges. They are getting customers via their referral & network
which is not scalable or predictable. They want to expand their revenue & create
a customer acquisition system but they don't have the time, expertise, or
resources to do it. 


We help companies like Jericho Security to create a predictable SQL pipeline
that can be scaled without your 0 micromanagement.


Is building a consistent client pipeline a priority at Jericho Security?

   2. 5,000+ leads generated
   3. A team of 25 qualified SDRs
   4. 96%+ email deliverability rate

Hi Madison,

In addition to my previous email, I just want to let you know that we take
complete ownership of the account right from the scratch till we schedule
the appointment with your sales team. Be it *creating an alternative
domain, configuring the email settings, creating the email script, warming
up the email account*, We do it manually without using any tools. It's like
you have a *remote SDR team which is on auto-pilot mode*.



Respond with a “*YES*” and we can plan the next steps

Hi Madison,

I haven’t heard back from you yet. I just want to check back with you one
more time regarding partnering with LeadShuttle. Here’s a step-wise
breakdown of our lead generation procedure:

   1. *Understand Ideal Customer Persona* : Understand your target audience
   and we give suggestions on the target expansion or revision
   2. *Build and Verify* : Generate contacts according to the given ICP
   from LinkedIn manually and extract their email address and verify them
   before campaigning
   3. *Campaign Management* : Launch the campaigns and we make sure our
   emails reach out to the recipient’s inbox
   4. *Nurture leads* : We nurture the warm responses and push them for a
   call by providing some useful information beforehand
   5. *Appointment scheduling *: We establish a rapport with the customer
   and schedule the appointment with your team

Can we have a quick call to discuss this further? How about *next Thursday?*

Did you know that 70% of the global workforce consists of passive talent?

At ChatterWorks, we've figured out the secret to effectively connecting
with these passive candidates.

We started ChatterWorks because much of today's recruitment happens before
the application stage. That’s why we created tools like our Chrome
Extension that seamlessly integrates with LinkedIn and other social
networks, alongside a web platform that lets you search our database
directly.

Feel free to accept my invitation and try ChatterWorks.

Search — it’s been a key pillar in marketing strategies for as long as we can remember. But like all digital tools, the landscape doesn’t stop evolving. And between algorithm shifts and the cookie's impending demise, it’s becoming harder than ever to maintain the same paid search results. That’s why performance marketers are increasingly turning to Connected TV to get their desired results — and the reporting to prove it.

Join MNTN’s Eric Hatzenbuhler, Director of Performance Marketing, as he walks you through CTV’s capabilities and how it can get you the insights you need to further your brand’s performance marketing strategy.

After this session, you'll be able to:


	- Apply tips for adapting your search strategies to CTV
	- Find a reliable attribution model that works for you
	- Leverage CTV to amplify results on channels you’re already using

.",Experiences and challenges with implementing a GRC framework
5566,bcc_email_sec_inbound,mhowe@agcpartners.com,"AGC Partners             Dear friends and colleagues:  In an era marked by the convergence of digital transformation, increasing business complexity, and a proliferation of threats and regulations, GRC Software has emerged as a catalytic force in a fragmented and outdated marketplace.  Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) software is an integrated, holistic approach to manage organization-wide governance, risk management, and compliance with regulations. GRC tools ensure that an organization acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite, internal policies, and external regulations through the alignment of strategy, processes, technology, and people, with the goal of improving an organization's efficiency and effectiveness.  With the growing complexity of business operations and regulatory requirements, GRC Software has not only become a comprehensive digital solution used by global enterprises but has also permeated across several different sub-sectors through domain and vertical specific GRC applications. Deployed over the cloud, GRC Software offers real-time visibility into risk and compliance data, automates complex processes, and facilitates improved decision-making.  The primary function of GRC Software is to automate much of the work associated with the documentation and reporting of the risk management and compliance activities that are most closely associated with corporate governance and business objectives. GRC has quickly evolved from being managed with pen and paper or excel spreadsheets to AI-powered and integrated platforms which now provide a single pane of glass for managing risk and compliance measures across organizations of all sizes and locations. Key trends driving GRC Software demand include increased frequency of regulations, convergence of GRC and cybersecurity, explosion of data and data risks, growing need of real-time visibility into risk and compliance data, redistribution of risk management, increased business complexity, continued focus on EHS and ESG, and the global adoption of AI and ML for automation, giving rise to predictive analysis.  The global GRC Software market is currently valued at 49B (up 15% Y/Y), indicating a growing recognition of its importance in business operations. Despite this, many organizations continue to grapple with manual and siloed GRC activities that result in inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and regulatory noncompliance. Historical incumbents have dominated the market, with GRC being traditionally seen as ""back-office"" technology. Today, digital transformation and complex regulations have propelled GRC Software into an agile industry, with front-office functions actively participating in risk and compliance decision-making.  This has led to a highly fragmented industry, featuring large/growth players with broad GRC platforms, as well as domain and vertical specific solutions that automate specific GRC applications. The future of GRC lies in cloud-based platforms that deliver rapid and sustained value to all stakeholders by integrating and automating data with AI, while also providing differentiated risk and compliance expertise. GRC will ultimately evolve into a holistic, organization-wide process; siloed approaches or hybrid services will likely not succeed.  GRC M&amp;A deal volume hit an all-time high in '21 with 199 completed deals, a significant ramp from its pre-COVID levels. Activity remained healthy in '22, dipping only slightly despite macroeconomic headwinds slowing other tech deal making. Transactions came roaring back in '23 with an estimated $34B in total value the most notable of which being Nasdaq's acquisition of Adenza for $10.7B last June. This momentum has continued into '24, with a flurry of notable transactions including EQT's $3B acquisition of Avetta in April, Hg's backing of CUBE in March and subsequent add-on acquisition of Reg-Room in May, and Archer's purchase of Flisk in February. Most recently, though, has been Hg's acquisition of Auditboard, a leader in the GRC space, for $3B last week.  While the paradigm shift in GRC Software is still in its early stages, it has created significant opportunity for growth stage technology companies with disruptive GRC platforms to win market share and will lead to heightened M&amp;A activity as private equity and large strategics invest more heavily in the future of the space. With over 400 companies identified in AGC's GRC Software landscape across Broad Integrated GRC, Domain Specific, and Sector Specific GRC Vendors, the industry is large, rapidly growing, and multifaceted with vendors touching several different areas of the ecosystem.

5598,bcc_email_sec_inbound,peoplecomm@gmail.com,"Hi Sage,

Cybersecurity Ventures is producing a documentary on the fastest growing
and one of the greatest threats to humanity: Cybercrime, and the most
important things that we can do to protect against it: Security awareness
training (for the world's employees) and human risk management.

The documentary will be released on the last day of Cybersecurity Awareness
Month (CAM), Oct. 31, 2024. CAM was previously known as National
Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCAM) which was launched in Oct. 2004. This
year marks the 20th anniversary of CAM.

The documentary will feature various important and prominent figures in our
industry including F500 and large enterprise CISOs.

The documentary is made possible by our sponsors. Each sponsor is being
selected for their contributions to the industry via their products and/or
services, and for having a thought leader who brings the credibility and
media experience to be cast in the documentary - which may be a video clip,
sound bite, still photo with voiceover, or other.

Each sponsor will have credits and their logo at the beginning and end of
the documentary - and each person who appears in the documentary will also
be in the credits.

We expect the documentary to be somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, but we
won't know exactly until we are deep into editing it.

We are offering your company the opportunity to be one of the sponsors, and
to include one of your experts (who we approve of) in the documentary.

There will be a lot of ongoing promotion of the documentary after it is
released.

COST to sponsor is $12,000.

We begin production in June, and we are finalizing sponsors over the next
week.

Let me know if your company would like to be a sponsor.

Thank you.
-Steve

Decibel Turns 5!

Decibel was founded 5 years ago to invest in technical founders at the earliest stage. So much has changed since our launch in 2019 but our founding values (https://www.decibel.vc/why-decibel) have stayed the same: Put Founders First. Have Conviction. Build Trust through Transparency. Run Towards the Fire.

Every founder can remember the significance of their early investors - they are true believers in your vision and show support when you need it most. It is our tradition every year to say “Thank You” to everyone who has been a part of the journey from the beginning - if you are on this list you are one of many friends, founders, investors, or partners who have helped us grow and expand over the past five years. Some recent milestones we reached this year include:
* Led 40 investments (https://decibel.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=84e2db3f3209f2680e78b3e3c&id=e4495aa6f9&e=958bfbff29) in Seed and Series A stage companies in our core investment areas of AI engineering, autonomous software, and cybersecurity.
* Announced the addition of Jess Leão (https://www.decibel.vc/articles/welcoming-jess-leao-as-decibels-newest-partner) and Lauren Ipsen (https://www.decibel.vc/articles/welcoming-lauren-ipsen-as-decibels-talent-partner) to our firm. We now have a team of 20 partners and founder advisors helping startups from the earliest stage.
* Grew our customer community to >2,000 early adopters in high-growth startups and Fortune 500 companies across every major technical domain.
* Expanded our reach into AI engineering in partnership with Latent Space (https://www.latent.space/) , which has become the leading podcast on all technical AI topics with over 2 million views since launch.
* Raised over $500 M in capital across our two funds from a diverse institutional LP base that shares our long term commitment to put founders first.

We are excited to share with you numerous updates on how our firm plans to evolve over the next 5 years and in many ways we are just getting started. The future is often fun to predict - how much can we all innovate to stay ahead in our rapidly changing world? We know that many things in our industry will undoubtedly change, but we also know that our values and commitment to founders will always stay the same.

Whether looking forward or back, I am reminded of the wisdom of a close mentor who has been in our industry for over 40 years: “In venture capital, your most valuable asset is not capital. It is trust. Be grateful to those that put their trust in you.” Thank you to everyone for putting your trust in our firm - we are very grateful to each and every one of you and would not be here without your support.

I look forward to seeing you all soon, and thank you again for being a part of the Decibel family.

Prowler: Leading the Open Cloud Security Movement

Prowler (https://prowler.com/) is an open cloud security platform that breaks from the traditional “black-box” model by offering an easy-to-use, adaptable, and community-driven approach to the complex challenge of cloud security. With over 6 million downloads and hundreds of contributors from companies around the world, Prowler has quietly become one of the most widely used open source cloud security platforms due to its ability to make security posture actionable and specific to the unique demands of a customer's environment. This approach brings the same agility and adaptability seen in cloud engineering for the first time to cloud security. The company launched the open cloud security movement earlier this year and our seed investment was covered by VentureBeat (https://venturebeat.com/security/prowler-gets-6m-seed-to-build-out-hit-open-source-cloud-security-platform/) .

Dropzone AI: AI Assisted Reinforcements for Cybersecurity Teams, Raises Series A!

Dropzone AI (https://www.dropzone.ai/) is a new platform for deploying AI-assisted “reinforcements'' for cybersecurity operations. Professional hackers have the upper hand when targeting an organization, often using automated attacks to create an overwhelming number of security alerts. The vast majority of these events must be manually investigated, putting cybersecurity analysts at a disadvantage in what feels like an asymmetric war. Dropzone enables defenders to automate their front line of defense, leveraging the power of LLMs to autonomously investigate security alerts, create real-time context, and empower human analysts to respond to only the highest impact events. The company’s recent Series A was covered in VentureBeat (https://venturebeat.com/ai/dropzone-ai-raises-17m-from-theory-ventures-for-its-autonomous-cybersecurity-ai-agents/) .
https://sublime.security/

Sublime: Rewriting the Rules of Email Security, Raises Series A!

Sublime (https://sublime.security/) is the first open security platform that lets anyone write, run, and share rules to detect and block email threats. Sublime has been rapidly growing and is now replacing major competitors in companies large and small. Founders Joshua Kamdjou and Ian Thiel saw a painful gap in the email security landscape that inspired them to start Sublime. Josh did offensive security at the Department of Defense for years, while Ian worked in product and growth at companies like Optimizely and Alto. Together, they’ve built a platform that rejects the traditional black box, walled-garden approach and instead empowers security teams to control their email environments by leveraging the power of a unified security community. The company’s recent Series A was covered in Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/04/24/ex-pentagon-hacker-raises-20-million-to-stop-chatgpt-fueled-cyberattacks/?sh=1a5fd8e6ea19) .

I am excited that it is getting closer to the day where I get to join
Jericho Security in the office! Now that it is my summer holidays, I have
taken a look at my training plan and I'm interested in starting my intern
role remotely as early as next week, till I fly over in August!

I have had a quick word with my program supervisor and he has given
clearance for me to ask for such an opportunity ☺️

I've taken some time to get a brief familiarisation of the web framework.

Sage - is your sales team getting enough high quality leads to work each month?

Reason I ask is we help marketing teams look like rockstars by driving 20-30 high quality leads to your sales teams calendar every month by providing high authority backlinks (DA 70+).

We recently helped KeyFactor, a PKI company increase organic traffic but 35% MoM through the last 6 months utilizing a strategy of contextually relevant backlinks featuring callouts and features in publications like Forbes.

Are you opposed to chatting about your growth strategy and how we might be leaving some leads on the table?

Hey Sage - Is getting your sales team more quality inbound leads a marketing goal this year?

Reason I ask is we help similar Cybersecurity organizations get 20-30 more qualified sales meetings each month by driving high quality backlinks to your site.

We helped Profisee, a MDM company increase website traffic by 542% over the last two years without spending a penny on ads, and I'm confident we can help Jericho Security too.

Send over your top 3 rivals. I'll reveal the keywords they're beating you on and devise a plan to capture that market share. Game?

 Selling with no leads is tough, and most companies are experiencing a sudden drop in new leads that started in late 2023. Is that what Jericho Security is going through as well?

We might be able to help if that's the case. Being an appointment setting agency, we can set up a business development team to: Find potential clients for Jericho Security Reach out and introduce your value proposition Identify interested ones and book appointments with your team With offices in Canada and Europe, we can set up a team that can reach out to hundreds of prospects and book 1-4 appointments every week within a tight budget of 3-4k/month.
 Does it make sense for us to discuss that in more detail?
I would be glad to talk, just let me know what is a good time.

TikTok Zero-Day Lets Hackers into CNN and Paris Hilton’s Accounts

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23672/ )

June 5, 2024
Hackers Exploit TikTok Zero-Day to Break into CNN Account
*What happened:* Threat actors exploited a TikTok zero-day bug to hijack high-profile accounts, including celebrities and companies, and plant malicious code on CNN’s official page. The now-patched flaw in the social media platform’s direct message feature allowed hackers to compromise accounts merely by having the target open a malicious message.
*Why it matters:* The White House has had TikTok on its radar recently, calling for its ban in the United States on national security grounds. In the run-up to the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, hackers are likely to conduct more such nuisance and disruptions in legitimate news sources to spread misinformation. Additionally, threat actors are likely to use information extorted from the hijacked high-profile accounts to target account holders in malicious attacks like phishing, extortion, and blackmail.

June 4, 2024
Data Breach at Australian Rare Earth Mining and Exploration Company
*What happened:* On June 4, 2024, ZeroFox observed an update on the BianLian ransomware leak site targeting Northern Minerals, an Australia-based mining company focused on the development of heavy rare earths projects. The breach included operational, shareholder, financial, and employee data.
*Why it matters:* Recently, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) warned of possible threats to its rare earths industry where threat actors aimed to steal state secrets. MSS stressed that some foreign enterprises had directed their operations in China to use their commercial activities as a cover to gather intelligence and internal data on the country’s rare-earth industry chain to steal commercial secrets and national secrets. It is possible that BianLian has similar motives of selling the breached operational details, Australian and foreign projects' documents, and research and development data to foreign actors looking to reduce their dependency on other countries for rare earth materials in its semiconductors, electrical vehicles, and weapons.

June 4, 2024
New V3B Phishing Kit Targets Customers of 54 European Banks
*What happened:* Threat actors are advertising a new phishing kit, V3B, on Telegram, targeting customers of 54 major financial institutions across Europe. Priced between USD 130 and USD 450 per month, it boasts advanced features like obfuscation, localization, OTP/TAN/2FA support, live chat with victims, and evasion mechanisms.
*Why it matters:* The emergence of V3B represents a significant advancement in phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms, offering sophisticated tools to facilitate cybercrime. Phishing kits like V3B can be utilized not only to harvest banking credentials and credit card details but also to facilitate broader follow-on cyberattacks. Moreover, the real-time interaction capability via the admin panel allows for customized phishing attempts, such as obtaining one-time passwords (OTPs), enhancing the kit's effectiveness in evading detection and perpetrating cybercrime. Its ability to evade detection by anti-phishing measures heightens the risk of successful phishing attacks, potentially leading to substantial financial losses and compromised personal information.

""The voice on the other end was familiar, or so it seemed. The bank manager, having dealt with this executive before, had no reason to suspect anything amiss.""

""But what the bank manager didn't know was that the voice he trusted was a meticulously crafted deepfake—a synthetic voice generated using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.""
This is not representative of the case details, since the case involved a meticulously planned deepfake video conferencing call, with numerous people being deepfaked at the same time. Please edit this accordingly, thank you!

| Verification and Authentication Procedures
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA for all financial transactions, including voice and video calls.
In-Person Verification: Require in-person verification or direct phone calls for large or unusual transactions.
Digital Signatures: Use digital signatures and encryption to verify the authenticity of communications and requests.
Training and Awareness
Employee Training: Regularly train employees on the risks of deepfake technology and how to recognize potential scams.
Phishing Simulation: Conduct phishing simulations and other cybersecurity drills to keep employees vigilant.
Technological Solutions
Deepfake Detection Software: Invest in deepfake detection tools to analyze video and audio for signs of manipulation.
AI-based Monitoring: Use AI and machine learning to monitor for unusual activity patterns that could indicate fraud.
Internal Controls and Procedures
Approval Processes: Establish stringent internal approval processes for…
This is a great start, but would like to see it be related back more to the context of the case. For example, requiring in person verification for the check would have prevented deepfake problems since it was such a large amount.

6345,bcc_email_sec_inbound,andrew@salesdevsn.com,"Hi Madison,
 So what do you think about having an appointment setting team for Jericho Security?
We can set up a team of 2-3 people within a very reasonable budget.
 This team will assess your ideal customer profile, find companies that fit, and reach out to them (via email, Linkedin, cold calls, etc.). They will do all the heavy lifting for your team to focus on discovery calls and closing deals.
 I understand that might sound very experimental for your business, but we did that for companies like CDS Cloud, Biovision DX, LiveChat, and others. We'd love to do that for Jericho Security as well.
 What do you think about a short discovery meeting?
Let me know what is a good time.

Subject: Appointment setting team | Jericho Security lead generation

 Hi Madison,
 Selling with no leads is tough, and most companies are experiencing a sudden drop in new leads that started in late 2023. Is that what Jericho Security is going through as well?

We might be able to help if that's the case. Being an appointment setting agency, we can set up a business development team to: Find potential clients for Jericho Security Reach out and introduce your value proposition Identify interested ones and book appointments with your team With offices in Canada and Europe, we can set up a team that can reach out to hundreds of prospects and book 1-4 appointments every week within a tight budget of 3-4k/month.
 Does it make sense for us to discuss that in more detail?
I would be glad to talk, just let me know what is a good time.

** NVidia + AI Growth
------------------------------------------------------------

Jumping right in this week. I’ve clearly been far too risk-averse when it comes to Nvidia. I’ve been concerned that their margins will be eroded by competitive forces like in-house design at Meta, Google, Amazon or Microsoft. While that may happen eventually, that’s not something that this market is concerned with at the moment.

I’ve started to wonder if NVidia’s actual advantage is less their technology and more that they have gobbled up all of the available physical resources needed to support the current configuration of top-tier AI. It turns out that building new power plants or substations is much harder than building new AI data centers, for example. Competitors can’t compete if they can’t access the physical resources needed to participate in the AI race.

There is a point when a company like NVidia becomes priced to perfection. I won’t prognosticate about where and when that happens. Besides the fact that Nvidia is in first place in the AI race, the links between NVidia’s sustained profitability and the overall AI economic opportunity are not clear-cut and dry to me. Leopold Aschenbrenner’s recent interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&ab_channel=DwarkeshPatel) with Dwaresh Patel presented some interesting numbers to support the overall AI opportunity.

Let's break down how AI tools can generate a staggering $100B in incremental new revenue. Consider the 300 million Microsoft Office subscribers, which includes CoPilot, their AI model. If 1/3rd of these users opt for a next-gen AI product at $100/mo, that’s a whopping $100B in incremental revenue. This justifies investments in AI superclusters and the necessary power infrastructure to support it.

If 1/3rd of subscribers paying $100/mo sounds like a lot, consider how advanced these tools can become. ChatGPT costs $20/mo because it’s still relatively primitive compared to the opportunity. Leopold claims that GPT-4 with 100 tokens per minute is roughly equivalent to him thinking for three minutes. When AI models can process millions of tokens in a single problem-solving session, theoretically, that could translate to an output equivalent to months of work, not just minutes. AI models will eventually incorporate planning, drafting, critiquing and error-correcting, producing dramatically better outcomes. In that context, GPT-4 seems primitive. An additional $100/mo is a bargain if it enables an $8k/mo employee to produce months of incremental work.

I don’t know where NVidia goes from here. The economic impact and growth potential of AI are undeniably significant tailwinds. I’ll also add that the AI growth theme is too substantial to care about 5% per year base interest rates, so rate cuts, rate hikes or higher for longer really have no impact, but those rates will impact other assets and sectors.



** Private Credit - Part 2
------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote last week about the overall context of private credit. I like the framing that private credit is a portfolio of loans funded by private investors. Private credit risk boils down to whether the managers act as responsible stewards of capital. That said, some issues are starting to emerge. Here are some risks that will eventually sour the overall reputation of private credit.
* PIK stands for payment-in-kind or synthetic payment-in-kind. It occurs when the borrowers cannot afford their interest payments, so lenders accept additional debt or equity added to their balance in lieu of payment. Intuitively, this should seem problematic. It’s happening now, and it’s not transparently reported to investors. These would be the first questions I’d ask about. Each fund has different concentrations of PIK.
* Flawed valuations. Are these loans worth what their owners say they are? Some funds may be justifying higher valuations with questionable methods to prop up their values and keep investors happy. There are incentives for managers to misrepresent the value of their loans.
* Leverage. What’s worse than a bad loan portfolio? Answer: a bad loan portfolio with leverage. Many private credit funds are levered 100%. Not all private credit funds use leverage.
* Historical Justifications. This is the blind leading the blind. Private credit producing X% over various historical periods tells us nothing about the quality of the loans or the economic environment supporting those loans. You have to look forward even though the future is uncertain and complicated. There’s no way around that exercise. Sales tactics that use historical performance justifications to sell these funds should make you uneasy.
* Liquidity and Duration Mismatch. Many private credit funds have loans with 5-7 year durations but offer liquidity quarterly. The problem with bank loan risk is that they fund 5-7 year loans with daily liquid deposits, which enables bank run risk. Shifting the liquidity from daily to quarterly does not solve the problem. Realistically, investor durations need to better match loan durations.
* Defaults within Private Equity. A majority of private credit loans, by volume, are to private equity borrowers. Many funds say they only lend to private equity-backed companies for financial safety. It may seem like private equity is immune to losses given their incredible run over the past ten years. On Friday last week, Vista Equity Partners wrote down the value of PluralSight, their portfolio company, from $3.5B to $0. Many large private credit managers own PluralSight loans with leverage. What will the value of those loans be post-restructuring, and how many other private equity portfolio companies are hanging on by a thread? Owning exclusively senior debt does not solve the bankruptcy risk.

Fortunately, some private credit funds address these issues better than others. No fund is perfect, and every investment comes with unique and complicated risks. I feel that niche managers can do a better job avoiding these issues.

""The voice on the other end was familiar, or so it seemed. The bank manager, having dealt with this executive before, had no reason to suspect anything amiss.""

""But what the bank manager didn't know was that the voice he trusted was a meticulously crafted deepfake—a synthetic voice generated using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.""

This is a great start, but would like to see it be related back more to the context of the case. For example, requiring in person verification for the check would have prevented deepfake problems since it was such a large amount.

Our latest quarterly newsletter is rich with exciting updates, featuring everything from our most recent investments, to a dive into AI with our executives, as well as founders and investors from our portfolio.

Earlier this week, Cisco announced a $1B global investment fund to expand and develop secure, reliable and trustworthy AI solutions. As part of the new AI fund, we announced we are making strategic investments in Cohere, Mistral AI and Scale AI among others to advance customers’ AI readiness and complement Cisco’s AI innovation strategy.

Over the past several years, Cisco has already made over 20 AI-focused acquisitions and investments, furthering GenAI and Machine Learning capabilities and integration of AI across the Cisco portfolio.

Vermin Deploys SPECTR Malware to Exfiltrate Data

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23689/ )

June 6, 2024
“Vermin” Attacks the Defense Forces of Ukraine
*What happened:* Threat actor group “Vermin” was observed targeting Ukraine’s defense forces, according to the country’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) and Cyber Security Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (CCB). The threat group reportedly deployed the SPECTR malware to steal data.
*Why it matters:* Authorities suspect that the Vermin threat group is from currently Russia-occupied Luhansk and was last seen in 2022. The suspected reemergence of this group raises a likely chance that other old time notorious groups may emerge to aid Russia’s hybrid war efforts.

June 6, 2024
Los Angeles Unified School District Investigates Data Theft Claims
*What happened:* The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) officials are investigating claims made by a threat actor stating that they're selling stolen databases containing records of millions of students and thousands of teachers. Meanwhile, ZeroFox has *observed* ( https://cloud.zerofox.com/intelligence/advanced_dark_web/65559 ) threat actor Satanic claiming to sell data belonging to LAUSD on the predominantly English-language dark web forum, “BreachForums.""
*Why it matters:* This incident raises significant concerns about the security of sensitive personal data within educational institutions, affecting not only students but also teachers and staff. The threat actor offered CSV files on a hacking forum, allegedly containing over 11 GB of data, including sensitive personal information. If verified, the breach could have serious implications for the affected individuals, including identity theft and privacy violations. Additionally, it underscores the ongoing threat posed by cybercriminals targeting valuable data repositories.

June 6, 2024
U.S. Government Attempts to Recover a Trade Union’s Funds Stolen Via Business Email Compromise
*What happened:* The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to recover over USD 5 million stolen from a Massachusetts trade union by business email compromise scammers, who funneled the funds into accounts in China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Nigeria.
*Why it matters:* Business Email Compromise (BEC) is highly likely to remain a pertinent threat to organizations across industries as threat actors continue to capitalize upon established techniques, high success rates, and constantly increasing financial payoffs. A ZeroFox brief *released* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23360/ ) in April noted a sharp rise in BEC attacks due to their high success rates and lucrative returns. Several high-profile BEC attacks have been observed this year, including a campaign *targeting* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/22891/ ) Western states with promises of substantial profits. Another campaign involved a BEC-specialized hacker group *impersonating* ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-impersonate-us-government-agencies-in-bec-attacks/ ) several U.S. government agencies to reportedly steal corporate credentials, infiltrate mailboxes, and conduct follow-on business email compromise (BEC) activity.

6895,bcc_email_sec_inbound,predictablerevenue-newsletter@mail.beehiiv.com,"Good morning Sage,

Can I get your feedback on something?

I’ve spent the last few months writing and sharing the core content from the book and my shitty first draft is getting close to being ready! I’m at 38k words with a target of 45k.

The content of the book has shifted based on the feedback you all have shared and I am grateful for all your replies and conversations we’ve had.

I initially started out to write a sales book for founders, focusing on what I’ve learned first hand and seen our customers go through in trying to build their first revenue team. The original idea was to build the book around our new four funnels methodology (meet, disco, manage, nurture). As I talked to more and more of you, I learned that there were three things people were asking about most:

1. Finding product market fit

2. Stepping into a sales role

3. Building your first sales team

People wanted to know what the major milestones were, the tactics involved in each, and how to know when you’re ready to move to the next one. The content evolved to address these three pillars and as it did, the frame for the book shifted. So I’d like to share the new frame, title, and table of contents with you and get your feedback.

Is this going in the right direction? What’s missing? What should be cut?

**Here’s the new title + subtitle: **

Caption:

**Here’s the new table of contents: **

Introduction

Section 1: Find Product Market Fit 

* Why PMF comes first 

* How to find a big shift in the market

* How to find unmet needs

* How and why you need to quantify your PMF 

* Closing your first $1m is an act of product, not sales

* How to find your first 100 customers 

Section 2: Founder Led Sales

* When you’re doing something new, DIY first 

* Don’t whip out your deck (how to run discovery / selling v / closing)

* Stop trying to close! (start building a business case)  

* Sales habits that will make your life easier (next actions, call on a call, pipeline stages tied to customer verifiable outcomes) 

Section 3: Building Your First Revenue Team 

* Who to hire next and when

* How to be a sales leader 

* How to find your next 100 customers (How to scale demand generation channels)

* How to tie it all together (the four funnels)

**And finally, the updated positioning statement: **

Audience. 
I am writing for founders responsible for revenue and are terrified because they don’t come from sales and everyone is relying on them for growth.

Core message.
The better your product meets an unmet need, the easier your go-to-market will be. 

Promise.
I wrote this book to help founders see that unmet needs are the through line from product market fit, to founder led sales, and building their first revenue team. By the end of the book, I’ll share how I progress from one stage to the next, what it takes to be great at each, and where I’ve fucked up so you can make diff mistakes. 

I can’t promise that demand for your product exists, that you won’t run into roadblocks (you will), or that you won’t make a bad hire (you will and that’s ok). This book was created to help you see the bigger picture so you can figure out for yourself what to do next. 

It’s been a journey to get here and I’m not done yet, thanks for riding along.

What’s one thing you’d change and one thing you’d keep the same from what I’ve shared today?

THE UNEXPECTED TWIST: HOW WE GOT THERE:=========================================
The sweet spot where Spontaneity meets Emotional Regulation, and the whole thing becomes a beautiful symphony of Personal Identity! Let me take you on a journey with my friends at XYZ Inc. , who were struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of their manufacturing process. 
As the production manager, Rachel was frantically trying to keep tabs on every single order, from raw materials to finished goods. Her team was working around the clock, but mistakes kept creeping in, and delays started piling up. It was like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while running a marathon – you get the picture!
Enter Enterprise Automation, the unsung hero that swooped in to save the day! By implementing automation solutions, XYZ Inc. was able to streamline their processes, eliminate manual errors, and free up more time for their team to focus on high-value tasks. 
Fast-forward six months, and the numbers started speaking volumes: a whopping 35% reduction in production costs! That`s not just a nice-to-have; it`s a game-changer! The company was able to redirect those savings towards strategic initiatives, like R and D, marketing, or employee development – you name it!
But here`s the kicker: the actual cost-savings number is only half the story. The real victory came from the emotional and psychological benefits that came with this newfound efficiency. 
For Rachel and her team, the stress levels dropped significantly, allowing them to focus on the bigger picture. They started having more meaningful conversations about innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction – topics that had been put on the backburner for far too long!
The automation didn`t just save time; it saved sanity! As one of Rachel`s team members quipped, With Enterprise Automation, we`re no longer drowning in paperwork and manual tasks. We can finally take a deep breath and enjoy the ride!
Now, I know what you`re thinking: This all sounds great, but how does this translate to our company? Well, let me tell you – the numbers are impressive across comparable organizations within our industry. 
Take ABC Inc. , for instance, which saw a 27% reduction in production costs after implementing automation. Or DEF Inc. , where they achieved a whopping 42% decrease! These companies, just like XYZ Inc. , were able to redirect those savings towards initiatives that drive growth and innovation. 
The takeaway? Enterprise Automation is not just about saving money; it`s about freeing up your team to focus on what really matters – creating value for customers, driving innovation, and building a strong company culture. That`s the real treasure!
As I sit here writing this article, I can`t help but think of all the companies out there that are still struggling with manual processes. It`s like they`re stuck in quicksand, slowly sinking into a sea of inefficiency.

So what are you waiting for? Dive into the world of Enterprise Automation, and get ready to reap the rewards!

THE APPROACH AND ITS SPECIFICS:===============================
Solution

As an Enterprise Automation expert, I`ve had the privilege of working with numerous organizations in the same industry as yours, and I`m happy to share some insights on the typical cost savings that companies like yours can expect after automating their processes. 

Industry Benchmarking

According to a recent study by Forrester Research, the average return on investment (ROI) for process automation initiatives in the [your industry] is approximately 30% within the first two years. This translates to an average cost savings of around $500,000 per year for companies with similar characteristics and size as yours. 

Key Findings

Our analysis of comparable organizations within your industry reveals some interesting trends:

1. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Automation: Companies that have successfully automated their manufacturing processes and supply chains have reported average cost savings of 25% to 30%. This translates to around $400,000 to $600,000 in annual savings. 
2. Business Process Automation: Organizations that have implemented process automation initiatives across various business functions, such as finance, HR, and sales, have experienced an average ROI of 20% to 25%, resulting in approximately $300,000 to $500,000 in annual cost savings. 
3. IT and Infrastructure Automation: Companies that have automated their IT and infrastructure operations have reported an average ROI of 25% to 30%, translating to around $400,000 to $600,000 in annual cost savings. 

Factors Influencing Cost Savings

While these benchmarks provide a general idea of the potential cost savings, it`s essential to consider various factors that can influence the actual ROI of your automation initiative. These include:

1. Industry-specific challenges: Your organization may face unique challenges or complexities that impact the effectiveness of automation. 
2. Automation scope and complexity: The more extensive and complex the automation effort, the higher the potential cost savings. 
3. Implementation quality and efficiency: A well-planned and executed automation implementation will generally yield better results than a rushed or poorly executed one. 

Conclusion

Based on industry benchmarks and our analysis of comparable organizations within your sector, companies like yours can expect to benefit from significant cost savings after automating their processes. The average ROI for process automation initiatives in the [your industry] is approximately 20% to 30%, translating to around $300,000 to $600,000 in annual cost savings.

I'm not sure it was full accuracy.  So I'd like to confirm that.  I spoke
with Anitha and there were still some gaps.  She also has a list of items
we are discussing internally on Monday, once we review that list, we will
share with you and your team.  There's always a chance for
misinterpretation, so I want to be certain we are hearing the same thing.

I understand your goals with the product and our goals are aligned in that
we want a stable, simple, accurate, lightweight product to get our
associates/ employees educated with the smallest footprint possible.

Saks has had consistent success in partnering with startups because we
follow a due diligence process.  Once we complete our internal reviews, we

# **What are the most valuable things everyone should know?**

Hi Sage, Sophia here, and today I wanted to share one of my favorite posts I found on Quora. It goes like this:

""What are the most valuable things everyone should know?"" by Jordan B. Peterson.

Tell the truth.

Do not do things that you hate.

Act so that you can tell the truth about how you act.

Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.

If you have to choose, be the one who does things, instead of the one who is seen to do things.

Pay attention.

Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you need to know. Listen to them hard enough so that they will share it with you.

Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationships.

Be careful who you share good news with.

Be careful who you share bad news with.

Make at least one thing better every single place you go.

Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.

Do not allow yourself to become arrogant or resentful.

Try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.

Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.

If old memories still make you cry, write them down carefully and completely.

Maintain your connections with people.

Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or artistic achievement.

Treat yourself as if you were someone that you are responsible for helping.

Ask someone to do you a small favour, so that he or she can ask you to do one in the future.

Make friends with people who want the best for you.

Do not try to rescue someone who does not want to be rescued, and be very careful about rescuing someone who does.

Nothing well done is insignificant.

Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

Dress like the person you want to be.

Be precise in your speech.

Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

Don't avoid something frightening if it stands in your way -- and don't do unnecessarily dangerous things.

Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

Do not transform your wife into a maid.

Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.

Read something written by someone great.

Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.

Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.

Don't let bullies get away with it.

Write a letter to the government if you see something that needs fixing -- and propose a solution.

Remember that what you do not yet know is more important than what you already know.

Be grateful in spite of your suffering.

7125,bcc_email_sec_inbound,aholidayiii@645ventures.com,"Hi Sage, we hope this email finds you well. We wanted to follow up on our
conversation regarding Jericho Security and provide some additional
feedback.

Firstly, we wanted to express how impressed we have been with the speed at
which Jericho Security has been building. It's evident that your team is
dedicated and committed to delivering innovative solutions in the
cybersecurity space.

As we discussed, we believe that new trust and safety solutions are
becoming increasingly important, especially given the rapid rise of AI. We
appreciate your taking the time to demo the product and share customer
references with us. It has helped us gain a better understanding of how
current users are experiencing the product.

During our conversation, we touched on the potential for a strong
opportunity in prevention. While we understand that Jericho Security's
wedge is in training/education and that you already have an early
prevention product in the market, we would prefer to see the product in the
market a bit longer before committing to an investment. This will allow us
to assess the efficacy of the product and make a more informed decision as
it relates to differentiation from the competition.

We'd like to reiterate that we are actively investing in Series A and
Series B rounds, and our check sizes can go up to $15 million. We see great
potential in Jericho Security and would love to be kept up to date on the
progress. Additionally, as you roll out the prevention product, we would be
happy to explore ways in which we can be supportive, such as making
introductions to CISOs in our network.

Thank you again for considering our feedback. We look forward to staying
connected and continuing the conversation.

Best regards,
Aaron

As I gaze out at the sunny New York skies, I'm reminded of the innovative
spirit that drives pioneers like yourself at *Jericho Security*. Your
recent 3 million pre-seed funding round is a testament to the cutting-edge

phishing attacks. Your work history, from product management to CEO,
demonstrates a relentless passion for staying ahead of the curve. I'm
thrilled to see Jericho Security's progress, especially given the

DDoS “Hacktivism” Attacks Plague EU Political Parties amid Elections

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

Hacktivists Target EU Political Parties in DDoS Attacks
*What happened:* Hacktivist group HackNet has claimed responsibility for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on election-related sites and political parties in the Netherlands, coinciding with the European Parliament elections. Agencies were able to thwart the attacks comprising three DDoS attack waves, peaking at 115 million and 44 million requests per hour.
*Why it matters:* Hacktivist attacks are more likely to be a general nuisance than a direct disruption in the election process or interference in the results. However, hacktivists can influence political landscapes and voter opinions, inconveniencing people and besmirching the electoral process, especially when the EU elections are underway. More hacktivists are likely to jump on the bandwagon and conduct such attacks during the election, thereby reflecting the increasing trend of politically motivated cyberattacks targeting democratic processes.

ZeroFox Intelligence Flash Report - ShinyHunters: An Insight into Future Extortion Tactics?
*What happened:* Threat actors have allegedly stolen the data of an unknown number of organizations via a compromise of the cloud data platform Snowflake. ZeroFox cannot yet independently confirm or deny the extent to which Snowflake is involved or how the alleged accessing of a demo environment could lead to the breach of multiple downstream customers. The full report can be accessed *here* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23697/ ).
*Why it matters:* ZeroFox anticipates there is a likely chance that other as-yet-unnamed organizations have also had data leaked, but may have chosen to buy back their data, or threat actors have yet to list it. The alleged breach of the cloud data platform Snowflake, and subsequent sale of data from alleged customers, may provide threat actors with a blueprint for the development of digital extortion tactics in the near future. The omission of encrypting payloads from extortion attacks will likely become increasingly popular amongst established extortion collectives—and will likely facilitate a larger pool of threat actors not historically involved in extortion to enter the digital extortion space.

June 7, 2024
750,000 People's Data Stolen in Frontier Communications Attack in April
*What happened:* American telecommunications company Frontier Communications has disclosed that a data breach (which was reported in the April 20 issue of ZeroFox’s Cyber Cyber Intelligence Daily Brief) affected over 750,000 individuals and exposed sensitive personal data, such as Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, credit scores, and phone numbers of customers. Last week, ZeroFox *observed* ( https://cloud.zerofox.com/intelligence/advanced_dark_web/65358 ) a post on the Ransomhub ransomware leak site targeting Frontier Communications, with a claim to have stolen 2 million customers’ data.
*Why it matters:* The exposed personal data creates opportunities for identity theft and fraud, potentially causing financial harm to affected individuals. Additionally, the stolen data can be leveraged for future cyberattacks, including phishing scams and targeted malware distribution, exploiting the compromised information to gain unauthorized access to accounts or perpetrate further breaches. Furthermore, the ransomware group's approach to selling stolen data, similar to their tactics following Christie's attack, indicates a pattern of criminal behavior aimed at monetizing illicitly obtained information. Meanwhile, the FCC has *proposed* ( https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-internet-routing-security-reporting-requirements-0 ) new rules for internet routing security, requiring Broadband providers to report their efforts in addressing vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

YOUR ORGANIZATION`S ENTIRE IT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A TICKING TIME BOMB WAITING TO IMPLODE DUE TO INADEQUATE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT.==========================================================================
The quest for reliable system configuration management. It`s a journey I`ve been on myself, as a former CISO at a mid-sized tech firm. Let me tell you, it wasn`t easy, but the lessons we learned along the way are invaluable. 
It all started when our company hit a growth spurt and our IT infrastructure couldn`t keep up. Our system configuration management processes were a mess – version updates were a nightmare to track, changes to software and hardware configurations were often lost in a sea of documentation, and audits? Forget about it. We were flying blind, relying on hope and prayer that nothing would go wrong. 
But then came the great audit of 2018. Our CEO asked me to lead an initiative to get our house in order, to guarantee the reliability of our system configuration management processes. I assembled a team of experts from across the organization, and we got to work. 
First, we standardized our version update process. We created a centralized hub for tracking changes, and implemented automated testing to ensure that updates didn`t break anything. It wasn`t sexy, but it was necessary. We had to be able to prove that our configurations were reliable, or risk losing the trust of our customers and investors. 
Next, we tackled the issue of change tracking. We developed a system for logging and auditing changes to software and hardware configurations. This allowed us to see exactly what had changed, when, and why. It was like having a digital paper trail – a valuable asset in any audit. 
Finally, we conducted regular audits to verify compliance with our established procedures. We created a schedule for these audits, and made sure that every department was on board. It wasn`t always easy, but it was essential. We had to be able to prove that our processes were working as intended, or risk facing the consequences of non-compliance. 
Throughout this process, I felt like we were playing a game of whack-a-mole – every time we`d squash one problem, another would pop up. But we persisted, and in the end, it was all worth it. 
As we implemented our new system configuration management processes, I thought about how much more reliable our infrastructure had become. I felt proud of what we had accomplished, knowing that we had taken a critical step towards ensuring the integrity of our systems. 
In hindsight, I realize that this process wasn`t just about complying with regulations or avoiding audits – it was about building trust with our stakeholders. It was about showing them that we were committed to doing things the right way, even when it got tough. 
So, how does our organization guarantee the reliability of its system configuration management processes? We standardized version updates, implemented change tracking and auditing, and conducted regular audits to verify compliance. And you know what? It`s working. Our systems are more reliable than ever, and we`re sleeping a lot better at night knowing that we`ve got this. 
This experience taught me the importance of having a robust system configuration management process in place. It`s not just about avoiding audits – it`s about building trust with your stakeholders, and ensuring the integrity of your systems. So, if you`re looking for a case study on how to guarantee the reliability of your system configuration management processes, look no further. This is the story of how we did it, and how you can do it too. 

THE APPROACH AND ITS SPECIFICS:===============================
Solution:

To guarantee the reliability of our system configuration management processes, our organization employs a multi-faceted approach that ensures the integrity, security, and consistency of all systems and their configurations. Here are the key mechanisms we use:

1. Version Control System (VCS):
- We utilize a robust VCS like Git or Subversion to manage version updates for all software and hardware configurations. 
- Each update is accompanied by a detailed description, timestamp, and author information, allowing us to track changes and maintain a complete audit trail. 
2. Configuration Management Tools:
- We use configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate the deployment, management, and versioning of system configurations. 
- These tools ensure that all systems are configured consistently and in accordance with our established procedures. 
3. Change Tracking and Auditing:
- All changes to software and hardware configurations are tracked using a centralized change management system. 
- This system records the reason for the change, the individual responsible for making the change, and the date and time of the change. 
- Regular audits are conducted to verify compliance with established procedures and to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. 
4. Regular Audits and Testing:
- We conduct regular audits to ensure that all system configurations are compliant with our established procedures and policies. 
- These audits include testing and verification of configuration management processes, as well as review of change logs and audit trails. 
5. Training and Awareness:
- All personnel involved in system configuration management receive comprehensive training on our configuration management processes and tools. 
- This ensures that everyone understands the importance of following established procedures and maintaining accurate records. 
6. Continuous Monitoring:
- We continuously monitor our system configurations for any changes or updates, ensuring that all systems remain compliant with our established procedures. 

Additional Measures:

To further ensure the reliability of our system configuration management processes, we:

1. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for personnel involved in configuration management. 
2. Implement a robust incident response process to address any issues or errors that may arise during system configuration management. 
3. Conduct regular security awareness training for all personnel to prevent insider threats. 
4. Engage in peer review and knowledge sharing among team members to ensure best practices are adopted and shared. 

By implementing these measures, we can be confident that our system configuration management processes are reliable, consistent, and compliant with established procedures, ensuring the integrity of our systems and the data they process. 

WORKFLOW:===========
Workflow: Guaranteeing Reliability of System Configuration Management Processes
Timeline: 14 days (7 days for initial setup, 7 days for audit preparation)
Responsible Roles:
1. System Administrator (SA): Responsible for daily system management and configuration updates. 2.

Audit Coordinator (AC): Responsible for preparing and conducting regular audits to verify compliance. 
Step-by-Step Workflow:
Day 1-3: Initial Setup (SA, CM)
1. Initial Configuration Audit: Conduct a thorough audit of the system configuration to identify current settings and establish a baseline for future changes. - SA: Provide detailed documentation on existing system configurations. - CM: Review and validate the documentation, identifying areas that require improvement or standardization. 2. Configuration Management Process (CMP) Development: Develop a CMP that outlines procedures for controlling version updates, tracking changes to software and hardware configurations, and conducting regular audits. - SA: Collaborate with CM to develop the CMP, ensuring it is comprehensive and easy to follow. - CM: Finalize the CMP and obtain approval from management. 
Day 4-7: Version Control and Change Tracking (SA, CM)
1. Version Control System (VCS) Implementation: Implement a VCS (e. g. Git, Subversion) to track changes to software configurations. - SA: Configure the VCS and set up a repository for storing configuration files. 2. Change Request Process: Establish a change request process for submitting, reviewing, and approving changes to system configurations. - SA: Develop a template for submitting change requests, including details on the proposed changes and their justification. - CM: Review and approve or reject change requests based on the CMP. 
Day 8-14: Regular Audits (AC, SA)
1. Audit Preparation: Prepare for regular audits by reviewing system configuration logs and identifying areas that require attention. - AC: Schedule audits and notify relevant stakeholders. - SA: Review system configuration logs to identify changes and ensure compliance with the CMP. 2. Regular Audit: Conduct a regular audit to verify compliance with established procedures, including:- Reviewing VCS logs for unauthorized changes. - Verifying that all changes have been properly documented and approved. - Ensuring that the CMP is being followed and that system configurations are in line with established standards. 3. Audit Report: Compile an audit report detailing findings, areas of non-compliance, and recommendations for improvement. - AC: Prepare the audit report and present it to management. 
Ongoing Responsibilities:
1. SA: Continue to maintain system configurations, track changes, and ensure compliance with the CMP. 2. CM: Monitor and update the CMP as necessary, ensuring that it remains effective in controlling version updates and tracking changes to software and hardware configurations. 3. AC: Schedule regular audits and review audit reports to identify areas for improvement. 
Additional Controls:
1. Access Control: Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes to system configurations. 2. Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up system configurations and have a recovery plan in place in case of unexpected changes or errors. 3.

hi everyone!

NY Tech Week 2024 is officially wrapped up! We had a record-breaking 740+ events (almost 2X growth from last year), tens of thousands of attendees, and so much diversity in the themes that were represented. AI was the most predominant theme, with fireside chats from companies on the bleeding edge, demo days and pitch competitions, talks by the mayor, and the convergence of so many industries from fintech, gaming, crypto, healthcare, cybersecurity and so much more. The NYC ecosystem is on a meteoric rise. (https://x.com/KatiaAmeri/status/1800159408770715799)

One Month since Small Business Expo (NYC)

 

Dear Mohamad ,
Last month, we had a great time at the Small Business Expo (NYC)! Connecting with all the small businesses and hearing their stories was amazing. We want to thank everyone who came by our booth and took the time to meet with us.

At SuccessLink, we are proud to deliver comprehensive outsourcing solutions tailored to meet the diverse needs of businesses across various industries. While other outsourcing companies require a moderately high level of outsourcing seats, we support businesses of all sizes so that we can grow together - with no minimum seat requirements to start.

If you would like to learn about our services and how we collaborate with businesses, you can visit the link below. Want to contact us directly? Call us today at 888-276-1670.

Thanks again and we hope to see you at the next event.

Sincerely,
The Team at SuccessLink Outsourcing

Please see the marked up version of the contract.  This thing truly has taken an eternity and I’m sorry for that.  Some questions I’d need guidance from your team would be on if we sell the co-created thing(s), who is the contract with the buyer going to be with? Will the buyer have individual agreements with each of us, paying us individually - or does the originating party handle the agreement and then pay the other party their portion? If the latter – will there be a way to track the sales and ensure proper split is issued? And do we need to create a three-way agreement template for MG, Jericho, and the buyer so we are all in the loop and using the same terms?  I’m not experienced enough in these agreements to 1) make a recommendation and 2) know what is comfortable for you.

Let me know how you’d like to move forward.

Hi Afiba and Shawn,

Great seeing you both today. As discussed, please find the updated contract attached for your legal team's review.

For next steps, I'll start drafting content for the Roundtable and the Offsite - @Shawn, if you could share any examples or templates of current McChrystal Group tabletop content, that would be much appreciated.

Additionally, Sage and I will be in DC next Wednesday (5/1) - would you both have availability for a working session in the afternoon? Let us know what works best for your schedule.

Thanks so much!

## NOTES

Hey there,

* Today’s a big religious day for me, perhaps my Holiest day. Yes, the WWDC Keynote. And this year it included massive updates that I absolutely loved. My quick couple of thoughts:

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1800235992978468885)

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1800286299070603759)

* **Prety disappointed none of the main AI features seem to be in the iOS18 betas that were just released. So basically everything is for later this year? Booo.**

* Later today I’m going to train kickboxing for the first time formally—other than one-off lessons. Pretty sure I’m going to sign up at the place and alternate between kickboxing and jits.

* **One of the most important conversations ever on AI Safety. A must-watch**. It’s 4.5 hours and better than any movie.

Youtube: Leopold Aschenbrenner - 2027 AGI, China/US Super-Intelligence Race, & The Return of History (https://youtu.be/zdbVtZIn9IM)

* Wrote a [new Fabric pattern called ](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)`capture_thinkers_work`, which does a capture of a thinker, author, or philosopher’s work. So basically their background, their main ideas, the work they produced, and more. Example:

`echo ""hayek"" | fabric -sp capture_thinkers_work`


* My thread on how to find a good mentor:

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1616200314478276608)

* Experimenting with adding source names to stories now so people can see where they’d be taken. A frequently-requested feature.

Ok, let’s get to it…

This is Jenna from SotaTek, a leading Vietnamese Software Development company. Nice to e-meet you.

I have noticed that a lot of companies in the EU area are looking for tech partners or IT resources in Vietnam to diversify tech vendors, which can help them to optimize the labor cost as well as easily extend their tech team. That is the reason why I want to reach out to you and want to be your partner to support Jericho Security with our dedicated developers.

SotaTek has been in business for 9 years with 1300 employees across Vietnam, and have completed over 500 projects for our clients. Our reputation and quality are proved by our collaboration with established organizations such as The Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training, Qcell, ... while we also accompany and assist many startups from scratch. We help them to solve the challenges of technologist constraints by helping them build & operate a technology team in Vietnam, and we hope we can do the same for you.

Is it possible for a quick meeting this week to discuss further if you need our support?
Please book the meeting here: Jenna's Calendly<https://calendly.com/jenna-nguyen-32th>

8060,bcc_email_sec_inbound,rise-with-rozenberg@mail.beehiiv.com,"Hey there, business trailblazers! Ready to unlock the secret sauce to deeply connect with your customers? Today, we're diving into one of the most powerful tools in your entrepreneurial toolkit: customer personas. Buckle up, because this is about to get transformative! 🚀

### Why You Need to Master Customer Personas

Imagine speaking directly to your audience's heart and soul, addressing their deepest desires and solving their most pressing challenges. Creating detailed customer personas can do just that. The reward? Higher engagement rates and more effective marketing campaigns that feel like magic. ✨

But here's the kicker: Despite the massive benefits, many businesses struggle to nail their customer personas. Why? Let's explore.

### Why So Many Get It Wrong

**The Main Reason**: Lack of Deep Dive
Many create shallow personas based on assumptions rather than real data.

**Other Reasons**:

* **Reason #1**: They skip customer surveys and interviews, relying on guesswork.

* **Reason #2**: They ignore data analysis, missing out on crucial trends.

* **Reason #3**: They create one-size-fits-all personas that don't reflect real-life diversity.

* **Reason #4**: They fail to update personas as customer behavior evolves.

Feeling overwhelmed? Don’t worry—we’re going to break it down step by step and show you how to create customer personas that truly resonate. Let’s go!

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Customer Personas

#### Step 1: Conduct Customer Surveys and Interviews 🎤

**Why It’s Crucial**: Real insights come from real conversations.

**Examples**:

* Schedule interviews with a diverse range of customers.

* Use surveys to gather data on their preferences, challenges, and behaviors.

_Pro Tip_: Use open-ended questions to get detailed responses. For example, ask ""What’s your biggest challenge in [your industry]?"" rather than ""Do you face challenges in [your industry]?""

**Quick Story**: Sarah, a small business owner, interviewed her top clients and discovered they all struggled with time management. She created a persona focusing on busy professionals and tailored her marketing to emphasize how her products save time. Her sales skyrocketed!

#### Step 2: Analyze Customer Data and Trends 📊

**Common Pitfall**: Ignoring valuable data.

**Examples**:

* Look at purchase history, website analytics, and social media interactions.

* Identify patterns and trends that reveal your customers’ behaviors and preferences.

_Pro Tip_: Use tools like Google Analytics and CRM software like our [RozenbergCRM.com](http://RozenbergCRM.com) to gather and analyze data efficiently.

**Why This Matters**: Many businesses overlook the goldmine of information right at their fingertips. By analyzing data, you can uncover hidden insights that shape your personas accurately.

#### Step 3: Develop and Document Your Personas 📝

**The Light at the End of the Tunnel**: Clarity and precision in your marketing efforts.

**Examples**:

* Create detailed profiles including demographics, psychographics, and behaviors.

* Give each persona a name and a story to bring them to life.

_Pro Tip_: Use templates to ensure consistency and detail in your personas.

**The Big Picture**: When you’ve completed these steps, you’ll have clear, actionable personas that guide your marketing strategies. This means more personalized campaigns, better customer engagement, and ultimately, higher conversion rates.

### Conclusion: Your Path to Marketing Mastery

Creating customer personas is your gateway to understanding and connecting with your audience on a deeper level. By conducting surveys and interviews, analyzing data, and developing detailed personas, you’ll transform your marketing efforts and watch your business soar. 🌟

**Your Action Plan**:

1. Schedule customer interviews this week.

2. Dive into your data analytics and identify key trends.

3. Create and document at least three detailed customer personas.

Brightwave: An AI Investment Research Assistant For Everyone

We are excited to announce our investment in Brightwave (https://decibel.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=84e2db3f3209f2680e78b3e3c&id=abc852ab5c&e=e9fe5ab43d) , the AI research assistant purpose-built for investment professionals. Generative AI has been one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years but its application for investment professionals have been limited to summarizing documents and asking questions of SEC filings. Brightwave is the first AI research assistant that generates trustworthy financial analysis on any investment topic. It helps users reason about risks and opportunities within specific markets and sectors, draw links between disparate topics such as rare earth metals and GPU production, and can provide sentence-level attribution for every research claim. Investors get more than facts and information - they get insights that help guide real-time investment decisions based on reasoning and analysis done at internet-scale.

As a CFO, your role extends beyond financial wizardry

Smart CFOs know that expanding into new products, exploring different regions, and increasing sales teams isn’t all about data and spreadsheets. Essential soft skills are needed to successfully lead through the unexpected twists and turns that come with business expansion.
The success of a company’s growth plan hinges on the art of effective leadership.
Join us in a discussion with finance expert Kyle Hegarty and explore the art of business expansion through the lens of a CFO, with a focus on essential soft skills needed to succeed.

Would further conversations be worthwhile? We're terrible salespeople but extremely talented engineers, so we quite simply offer a ""try before you buy"" option. All we ask is that you continue with us if you are happy with our work.

Let me know what you think!

Just wondering — what does it currently cost to run your cap table?


I ask because most platforms (e.g. Carta) are over priced. They increase the
cost for every employee and investor you add to your cap table, and often aren't
up front about renewal conditions.


I’m Avi from AngelList and we do doing things differently that is easier on the
wallet.


By making the switch, most founders reduce cap table expenses by 50%, and our
pricing is fair + based on count of employees with options. (our product is
better, too).


Would you be interested in a quick chat in the next few days to discuss the
details? We’ll arrange the setup for you in just a few days.


Warm Regards,

 Hi Grace,
 We are constantly evaluating our policy templates and incorporating feedback from audit partners and customers. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we reviewed our policy offerings and have decided to make two additional policies available to all of our frameworks by default.
 The policies will impact your readiness score if you are not already managing them. We will release the following two policies next Tuesday:
 - Change Management Policy - This will cover requirements for managing other types of changes that are not related to software development, which were the only types of changes covered by our existing Software Development Life Cycle policy template. This policy was previously only associated with select frameworks and now it will be pre-mapped to all by default.
 - Logging and Monitoring Policy - This was added because we did not have a specific policy template covering these specific topics. While there was some language in some policies around logging in, it was scattered across different templates.
 In order to get back your previous readiness, you have two options:
 - Option 1: Archive the policies. You're not required to adopt these policies. If you have an existing compliance program that does not include these policies and do not wish to adopt them, you can archive them.
- Option 2: Adopt the policies. Your other option is to adopt these policies. Review the contents, customize as needed, approve them, and then send them to your employees to acknowledge, if applicable. You may also consider reviewing their contents and copying into your existing policies if you do not wish to use these stand-alone templates.
 Reminder: The two policies will be added on June 18, 2024.
 Thanks,
 Ashley Hyman VP of Customer Experience",Important: Two New Policies for All Frameworks

I have two questions regarding the coding assignment:

   1. Are there any rules for the entry and exit points? Should they be set
   on the border of the maze, or can they be random points within the maze?
   2. When accessing previously generated mazes, should these mazes
   demonstrate a graphical representation of the solution again, or are they
   just for viewing?

Thank you,

Snowflake Compromise Claims Another Victim

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

Pure Storage Discloses Data Breach Caused by Snowflake Workspace Compromise
*What happened:* Pure Storage *confirmed* ( https://support.purestorage.com/bundle/m_security_bulletins/page/Pure_Security/Security_Bulletins/topics/concept/c_Security_Bulletin_for_Unauthorized_Access_to_Telemetry_Information.html ) a breach involving its Snowflake data analytics workspace, adding it to the list of victims affected in the Snowflake cyberattack. Pure Storage has confirmed that although some telemetry information (including company names and email addresses) was exposed, the breach did not compromise customer data.

*Why it matters:* The threat analysis firm hired to investigate the Snowflake credentials compromise has *attributed* ( https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/11/crims_targeting_snowflake_customers/ ) it to threat actor group UNC5537. The firm further stated that the adversary has hacked into 165 organizations with the help of stolen Snowflake credentials. In a report released earlier this month, ZeroFox also *warned* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23697/ ) that more organizations, besides TicketMaster and Santander, might have had data leaked. It is also important to note that the breach sets precedents for future digital extortion tactics, with a trend toward omitting payload encryption to attract more threat actors.

June 11, 2024
City of Cleveland Shuts Down IT Systems After Cyberattack
*What happened:* The City of Cleveland took its citizen-facing services, like public offices and City Hall, down after a cyberattack. Ongoing investigations reveal the incident has not impacted any essential services like healthcare and utility.
*Why it matters:* Investigations are still underway to determine the type of cyberattack. No threat actor has claimed the attack and neither has any ransom been demanded, at the time of writing. However, Cleveland has a population of two million and is considered to be a significant economic center in Ohio. Forcing the city to take some of its services offline could mean backlogs and delays, which could cause financial losses.

June 11, 2024
Massive Global DNS Probing by Chinese Actor SecShow
*What happened:* Cybersecurity researchers have identified a Chinese actor, SecShow, conducting large-scale Domain Name System (DNS) probing since June 2023. SecShow operates from the China Education and Research Network (CERNET), a project funded by the Chinese government.
*Why it matters:* The researchers have warned that the probes in question targeting DNS responses at open resolvers could facilitate future malicious activities. Threat actors can use open DNS resolvers in various cyberattacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. SecShow's use of IP Address Spoofing Techniques raises concerns about data gathering for undisclosed purposes, highlighting the risks of transparency and security. The activity mirrors another China-linked threat actor, Muddling Meerkat, known to demonstrate a pattern of prolonged, undetected probing.

About 500,000 at Risk in Christie's Breach
(via Bleeping Computer (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/christies-starts-notifying-clients-of-ransomhub-data-breach/) )

Christie's, a British auction house, is notifying individuals whose data was stolen in a recent network breach that was noticed on May 9th. After becoming aware of the breach, Christie's attempted to secure its network by hiring external cybersecurity experts to investigate the impact of the incident.

The RansomHub gang has claimed responsibility for the breach and is auctioning the data on its dark web leak portal. The data is purported to contain PII such as names, addresses, ID document information, and other sensitive information.

Hope this email finds you thriving in your business pursuits. I wanted to
circle back and shed light on a common pain point we all face – the
never-ending battle with accounting complexities.

Ever considered the immense value of outsourcing? Let me share some
eye-opening stats with you. According to a study by Clutch, 70% of
businesses experienced significant cost savings by outsourcing their
accounting needs. Another study by Xero found that businesses saved an
average of 11 hours per week by outsourcing bookkeeping.

Now, imagine those hours reclaimed for strategic business decisions rather
than crunching numbers.

Fusion Business Solutions Private Limited (FBSPL) is your ideal partner in
this transformative journey. Our diverse skillsets, flexibility with all
cloud-based accounting software, and custom automation solutions set us
apart. Imagine the peace of mind that comes with accurate financial records
and a team dedicated to optimizing your processes.

These differentiators aren't just promises – they're the backbone of our
commitment to simplifying your accounting.

Curious to explore how outsourcing with FBSPL can elevate your business?
Let's hop on a call to delve deeper into your unique needs and how our
tailored solutions can make a tangible difference.

When will be a good time to connect?

You're in good company - we’ve recently delivered roundtables and SQLs for:

SQLs, in 6 steps:

- A dedicated project manager will consult with you to create a theme for the discussion.
- Once confirmed, we will supply an appropriate moderator for the discussion and organise the location of the event (in-person or virtual).
- Our marketing team will create a dedicated website and execute a multi-channel marketing campaign to recruit attendees that fit your target market.
- We will provide you with regular reports on registrations, prepare your experts for the discussion, and introduce them to the moderator.
- On the day of the event, we will be there to fully facilitate the event, ensuring it runs smoothly. Two members of your team can attend the meeting.
- Post-event, we will provide you with contact details of all attendees, allowing your teams to organise follow-up discussions.

Sage, I'm on vacation this week, enjoying some sun, sand and suds.  Unfortunately, cyber crime never takes a vacation, and here's an article you need to know about:  Phishing for Gold: Cyber Threats Facing the 2024 Paris Olympics | Google Cloud Blog (https://d2pKYG04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RJ+113/d2pKYG04/VWczhd2FWYLzW8y0D3M7Y5xM9W5l3Nw35ggg44N7gG80q3pyd0W95jsWP6lZ3q3Vzd3xd2XvLTkW3SB4-f23cffhW4WtgCy3Ng5WyW5g3--4228z5DN2BSFYmPFh3CMSZytqHvVLKW8X2mSy5khHBCW3x9Rpf8R17fxW2PBzVn6S7-2QW4PnPQ142VqH0W89B1Yr5P7f1NW56tF5K19YsxvW5vXdzL4c-2BMMrPQvsZWSfKW12M3dS7f5tJGW1MZJwK4kw1xfW6w3FdW8zKzn3VR2hRC3fSqclN8cFyN3l8zsVW1wSQ0V27SW-tM1xw2kD5rx-W7j70hh1NLlQ8W6_szQt6Cv6phW4spj5L8F31G3W6DlTS61PyMcSN1ZR8fm7cxG_W8Zk65d80MB0tN7mlx4WKZ1jbMkqHVkZTL2SW4HfN0x945g-jf2FQ7nH04 ) .

According to Mandiant, ""Olympics-related cyber threats could realistically impact various targets including event organizers and sponsors, ticketing systems, Paris infrastructure, and athletes and spectators traveling to the event. Financially motivated actors are likely to target the Olympics in various ways, including ticket scams, theft of PII, and extortion against entities during a period of heightened pressure. Capitalizing on interest in the games, threat actors are likely to use Olympics-related lures in social engineering operations that are not necessarily targeting the games.""

As with any other popular topic, the Olympics presents opportunities for phishing scams in both email and social media.  Unsuspecting employees clicking on a link to learn more about an Olympic event can unknowingly download malware, giving a cyber criminal an entry point to you organization.

You need real-time visibility and control over the attacks your employees see so they can be blocked before they happen.  The ONLY solution that allows this is PhishCloud!

It's time for change.  It's time for PHISHCLOUD!

Smishing is a rapidly evolving form of phishing, where hackers send SMS messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Over the past year, there has been a worrying increase in these attacks.

FACT: Only 35% of the population know what smishing is (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://d4Lz-q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RL*113/d4Lz-q04/VX6PMr1Cmhn5N55zCb6sNCKqW842MfZ5ggpjJN1YBnw43pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3mNW4C50m87DV6d1W6hBv_f3R2k7rW5pQ9w148v4DJN7ZVh3GBsfhTW5wC-S61l2lGDW2SbPvJ29zGnbW96NXhk23b13LW6tG3sW2L8SvlW7Jr6fJ3Hvk6DW7TPcK32rP062W1GqWhh26xjxyW3MyjZS1mq4_0N3N0nP7t7PFPW7W7GkL93D2N9W12XVRz3GJ-Y0N1z6R5l_8G-6N7l4VHyrqM9QW7vz_Yg3S4NvmW4_7Clg3mkL3nVK7mgR8mHm2CW45Dsgk4cCY2mW87k3hk2yCK2VW5fy4_45m9YCdW4Dmrk-8J5LqVF1GMNflgt8NW7vB0pY5PD9F6N7zX6N2jNg2sM-cwPPXtn32dQ0pVY04__;Kw!!AgknpJoImQ!lTPLVZEtcFdt6QT5EX2IayzPl-kDpJMJv4ESPe2GI9m8PKWyCeve9GMUwFhXsm9i12Stf4dolmqX8hwUgw$  ) , according to a survey by Safety Detectives. The lack of awareness, combined with the high response rates to SMS messages, makes smishing one of the most threatening cyber attacks today.

Smishing is a rapidly evolving form of phishing, where hackers send SMS messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Over the past year, there has been a worrying increase in these attacks.

FACT: Only 35% of the population know what smishing is (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://d4Lz-q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RL*113/d4Lz-q04/VX6PMr1Cmhn5N55zCb6sNCKqW842MfZ5ggpjJN1YBnw43pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3mNW4C50m87DV6d1W6hBv_f3R2k7rW5pQ9w148v4DJN7ZVh3GBsfhTW5wC-S61l2lGDW2SbPvJ29zGnbW96NXhk23b13LW6tG3sW2L8SvlW7Jr6fJ3Hvk6DW7TPcK32rP062W1GqWhh26xjxyW3MyjZS1mq4_0N3N0nP7t7PFPW7W7GkL93D2N9W12XVRz3GJ-Y0N1z6R5l_8G-6N7l4VHyrqM9QW7vz_Yg3S4NvmW4_7Clg3mkL3nVK7mgR8mHm2CW45Dsgk4cCY2mW87k3hk2yCK2VW5fy4_45m9YCdW4Dmrk-8J5LqVF1GMNflgt8NW7vB0pY5PD9F6N7zX6N2jNg2sM-cwPPXtn32dQ0pVY04__;Kw!!AgknpJoImQ!lTPLVZEtcFdt6QT5EX2IayzPl-kDpJMJv4ESPe2GI9m8PKWyCeve9GMUwFhXsm9i12Stf4dolmqX8hwUgw$  ) , according to a survey by Safety Detectives. The lack of awareness, combined with the high response rates to SMS messages, makes smishing one of the most threatening cyber attacks today.

Are you the right contact to speak to regarding security at Jericho
Security? If not, I would really appreciate it if you could point me in the
right direction.

I'd like to offer Jericho Security a couple of our AI powered cameras for a
month (at no cost, we'll even pay shipping both ways) -- our security
solution is designed to alleviate the day-to-day pain points of legacy
systems for end-users and reduce the total cost of ownership and
administrative overhead for key stakeholders.

If physical security doesn't pertain to you, my sincere apologies as I'm
still getting my bearings -- would you be able to help me get this offer to
the right person?

Best,

Hi Mohamad Iyan Danial

Thanks for joining us for our SMX Advanced demo session, How to create thousands of custom campaigns in seconds with Fluency Blueprints. We hope we made it easy for you to imagine how your teams can launch and optimize thousands of custom, data-powered campaigns, and at scale with Blueprints.

We will be sharing the on-demand recording as soon as it's available. In the meantime, we wanted to make sure you had a few other resources.

Smishing is a rapidly evolving form of phishing, where hackers send SMS messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Over the past year, there has been a worrying increase in these attacks.



FACT: Only 35% of the population know what smishing is<https://d4Lz-q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RL+113/d4Lz-q04/VWgHz37SDwblVt6Z3_4dWXWhW6D6W6y5ggptrN6G5Tr-3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3m_MbLGB74t4D7W77sK9f4zTzJQW6G-D7h8bqGQ7W7-PByt2G5fwTW31RkF596w2H1W73wcxx8PRMhXW89W3Mr4qCW25W3gprxs2LjjxwW4dKgKH4h8ZtRMhr54lhTbcLW4L46Yt1C3GfnW5lkSQy8CZ10tW3bXRzK2HRlVzN2nkLm-7kly3W6zqKw33y-z8qW3mrQld528vY-W1_vFbQ6qGhdqW41pCWt95cF0QVwWmJp92yPkkW7Ntd004ZmRR9VQ06Yl5Qmt4pVc6DMJ17-5zlW4983HC4VW2tQN6f64QDgYL-NW18Xn007Q_rCHW1Vc8xC4NsV0DW5LX7Xv5S9n1BW1LhPYF1LPDGkf8QdTFd04>, according to a survey by Safety Detectives. The lack of awareness, combined with the high response rates to SMS messages, makes smishing one of the most threatening cyber attacks today.

Thank you for completing that so promptly.

Joel has raised all the queries in Drata, as soon as you have responded
to/uploaded additional evidence to them we can begin the reporting process
that usually takes 1-2 weeks once all evidence has been verified.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

 Namespaces
 Let’s start with namespaces! Did you know we split them by default into web and background? Though, the real fun begins when you add your own.
 At AppSignal, we separated our API and Admin namespaces so we can have custom thresholds and notification settings for each.
 Anomaly detection
 Next, how about diving into anomaly detection to raise the alarm when something isn’t quite right? Set up triggers for those abnormal situations that need some investigation.
 You can set alerts for things like high error rates, low throughput, long queue times or out of control host metrics in any way you'd like (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc).
 Will you let me know if these were helpful or if you would like to stop the next emails with tips?
 Best, Wes [This is tip 1 of 4] :)",Tip 1: Our top tips for getting started in AppSignal

Hi Chris,

I saw that you’re the Head of Marketing

I did some

for your sales team that are meticulously filtered to ensure they align with
your specific criteria and business needs.

With our content syndication, you
can get high quality deeper funnel leads through the integration of custom

Can we connect on a quick call Monday or

Sure you get a ton of emails, and I definitely don't want to waste your
time.

As a refresher, I single-handedly built out Nymity's entire Business
Development program from scratch to over $11m in sales, which helped them
get aquired by Trustarc.

If growth is ever top of mind for you guys, I would love the opportunity to
discuss how I could assist in that regard.

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to you as a follow-up to our previous conversation about your urgent need to fill the software engineer role at your organization.

As we discussed, this is a critical position for your team, and I believe I have several highly qualified candidates who would be a great fit. Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from you regarding scheduling interviews or moving forward with the hiring process.

I understand that you're busy, but I wanted to gently remind you that time is of the essence. The longer this role remains unfilled, the more it can impact your operations and productivity.

Would you be available for a quick call this week to discuss next steps? I'm happy to provide you with more details on the candidates I've identified and to coordinate the interview scheduling at your earliest convenience.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I'm committed to helping you find the right person for this role as soon as possible.",Re: We'd Got Cybersecurity Expert for your Company

North Korea’s Moonstone Sleet Expands its Targets to the Software Supply Chain
*What happened:* A North Korean APT called Moonstone Sleet, which was identified last month, has expanded its distribution of malicious node package manager (npm) code to public repositories, posing a threat to the software supply chain by poisoning open-source code repositories.
*Why it matters:* As reported in ZeroFox’s Cyber Daily Intelligence Brief of May 30, researchers *discovered* ( https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/microsoft-moonlight-sleet-apt-melds-espionage-financial-goals ) Moonstone Sleet conducting financially motivated attacks and cyberespionage campaigns. While its quick expansion of techniques warrants attention, Moonstone Sleet's targeting of the software supply chain is also indicative of the growing risk to the open-source ecosystem, as demonstrated by the large-scale impact of previous supply chain attacks. Supply chain attacks affect all users of the compromised software and can have widespread consequences for government, critical infrastructure, and private sector software customers. With China’s persisting geopolitical tensions with other nations, other Chinese state-sponsored actors will likely follow Moonstone Sleet’s suit to conduct supply chain attacks.

June 14, 2024
ZKTeco Biometric System Found Vulnerable to 24 Critical Security Flaws
*What happened:* Researchers have detected 24 vulnerabilities in a hybrid biometric access system from Chinese manufacturing company ZKTeco. The flaws include SQL injections, stack-based buffer overflows, and command injections.
*Why it matters:* These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to defeat authentication, steal biometric data, and deploy malicious backdoors. Exploiting them can lead to significant risks since attackers can sell biometric data on the dark web, allowing actors to potentially create deepfakes and conduct sophisticated social engineering attacks.

June 13, 2024
NATO to Crack Down on Russian Spies in Response to Sabotage
*What happened:* NATO has decided to undertake “tougher action” against Russia in light of recent acts of sabotage and cyberattacks, including disinformation, against NATO allies.
*Why it matters:* The military alliance also plans to prioritize protecting its maritime and cyber infrastructure while tightening restrictions on Russian intelligence personnel. The added security measures may be instrumental in safeguarding member states to better protect themselves from recent Russia-led cyberattacks where a Russian-backed cybercampaign *targeted* ( https://reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/russian-cyber-attacks-targeted-defence-aerospace-sectors-berlin-says-2024-05-03/ ) government bodies, ""critical infrastructure operators"" and other entities in Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden.

London Hospitals Cyber Incident Causes Severe O Positive and O Negative Blood Shortage
*What happened:* England's NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has urgently called for O positive and O negative blood donors to book appointments and donate following last week’s cyberattack on pathology provider Synnovis. Many non-urgent procedures have been canceled or redirected.
*Why it matters:* The attack disrupted services at multiple hospitals in London, making it difficult to quickly match blood donor and recipient types. This raises the risk of transfusion mismatches, which could lead to life-threatening complications. The London hospital incident is part of a series of ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations this year, which have compromised patient services and exposed sensitive data. The much-publicized and disruptive impact of attacking healthcare services makes these organizations lucrative targets for extortion, potentially endangering patient lives.

ZeroFox Intelligence Flash Report - Threat Actor Linked to ShinyHunters Advertises Extortionate Data Breach
*What happened:* On June 11, 2024, untested threat actor “sp1d3r'' advertised the sale of a notably-large leaked data set in the Russian-speaking dark web forum xss. The breach allegedly contains 65,000 records of data stolen from a U.S.-based financial organization that purportedly include both personal financial information (PFI) and personally identifiable information (PII).
*Why it matters:* The owner of this stolen data is likely a victim of the ongoing fallout of the alleged breach of cloud-based service provider Snowflake. Since the alleged breach on May 23, 2024, several of Snowflake’s assumed customers’ data have been advertised on deep and dark web (DDW) forums. Sp1d3r is almost certainly synonymous with, or heavily associated with, threat actor “ShinyHunters”, who is very likely responsible for recent attacks against Snowflake customers. In the coming weeks, it is very likely that additional Snowflake customers will be implicated in data breaches, with the stolen information being advertised for sale in DDW forums.

June 12, 2024
City of Cleveland Shuts Down IT Systems After Cyberattack
*What happened:* The City of Cleveland took its citizen-facing services, like public offices and City Hall, down after a cyberattack. Ongoing investigations reveal the incident has not impacted any essential services like healthcare and utility.
*Why it matters:* Investigations are still underway to determine the type of cyberattack. No threat actor has claimed the attack and neither has any ransom been demanded, at the time of writing. However, the City of Cleveland has a population of two million and is considered to be a significant economic center in Ohio. Forcing the city to take some of its services offline could mean backlogs and delays which could cause financial losses.

I've been following your journey as the CEO & Founder of *Jericho Security*,
and I must say, your dedication to AI-powered cyber security training for
employees is truly inspiring. Your recent funding round, securing 3 million
to combat emerging generative AI-powered phishing attacks, is a testament
to your innovative approach. As someone who has navigated the complex
landscape of cybersecurity, I'm sure you're aware of the significance of
staying ahead of the curve.

In this quarter's Q2, I'd like to highlight how * Koop

automated risk management and compliance solutions can help Jericho
Security streamline its operations, optimize coverage, and reduce insurance
costs by over 30%. Our tailored preventive insurance solutions, such as
General Liability and Cyber Liability, can provide the necessary protection
for your organization. Additionally, we offer incentives like a 1,000
credit towards SOC 2 compliance certification for customers.

Symantec and Fortinet are also making significant strides in this space,
but I believe Jericho Security's unique approach with AI-powered training
sets you apart. I'd love to discuss how Koop can support your mission to
""fight AI with AI"" and help you stay ahead of the competition. Let's *

As a growing telecom company with only an outbound sales strategy and a new 10x ARR goal, their new VP of Marketing knew he had to quickly build an inbound engine that would also win the trust of the sales team

And he did. Here's how Maurer shortened a 150-day sales cycle by 75%, with 400% ROI on pipeline generated, and how you can do it too.

Step 1: Define your audience

Maurer needed to reach companies with $50M - $1B in revenue from the financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare industries. Using that criterion, ViB identified a list of zLinq's ideal customers from our ViB Community, which is our millions-strong network of tech professionals.

How the ViB Community works (https://d2tb0Y04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/2N+113/d2tb0Y04/VXjBq74Qmxj0W5RRcVK80nHC8W8fXtNV5gqL0wN4zFKLR3pyd0W7lCdLW6lZ3nNW8k1n754pKp1qW7Ng3W97m4xLKW6WR7BY7rzt51W3FMPWm1LB5FmW7Xcrsl3Y-KjDW7FY4Wq7ST0l-W3j0s0Q4xFxBfW468tt7452JJgW26qyM_7wRYqdN3GJ47Nz2vspW4RcjwF6g1By3W5BbLZ_4P4CKBW1kXdm73_H9SQW4hblNH5kwPv8W1y23zN1jqCStW4gCMxd5xbfQ7W5rrPD942-5-xN8TqghcHQkyVVTnD596WD-znW4d4MB3636f-lVY1Fch1KCk9mVP5vWg6KCdttW3ygwSm545rGBW6443sY3-RT7vf6vMj-M04 )

Step 2: We pitch the solution

Next, ViB built a vendor-neutral landing page to promote zLinq's voice and data lifecycle management solution, specifically highlighting the pain points it would solve. This formula is how we attract only qualified prospects interested in the solution.

“The leads we received from the ViB Community matched our criteria exactly. They needed our solution to solve their voice and data management challenges. So they were immediately ready for a sales meeting,"" says Maurer.

Step 3: We generate demo-ready leads

Finally, by promoting the landing page to select Community members on our dedicated portal, ViB generated 15 appointments as part of zLinq's pilot Appointments campaign alone. ""We reached that target quickly,” says Maurer.

Hi Sage,


After going through the Jericho Security's website and LinkedIn page, it caught my attention that you are currently looking to expand your team with remote developers. Recognizing the potential synergy between our offerings and your requirements, I am reaching out to explore the possibility of collaborating with Jericho Security.


At Bacancy, we have a dedicated team of experts proficient in Java, Javascript, .Net, ROR, Ui/UX, Front end, Full stack, Data Engineering, Salesforce, and Dynamics 365. Our flexible engagement models, including Fixed Cost and Time & Material, are tailored to suit the unique needs of our clients. Additionally, we understand the importance of building trust in our partnership, and to that end, we offer a one-week free trial of a developer.


I am keen to discuss how we can align our resources to meet Jericho Security's development needs effectively. Could we please schedule a brief call at your earliest convenience to delve deeper into your requirements and explore potential collaboration? You can also book our meeting directly on my calendar - ""Mukesh's Calendar"".


I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further and demonstrate how our team can contribute to the success of Jericho Security.

Sure you get a ton of emails, and I definitely don't want to waste your
time.

As a refresher, I single-handedly built out Nymity's entire Business
Development program from scratch to over $11m in sales, which helped them
get aquired by Trustarc.

If growth is ever top of mind for you guys, I would love the opportunity to
discuss how I could assist in that regard.

Dear Customer, We're pleased to announce that your online banking platform business Bridge® Premier will soon be updated to include several improvements. These enhancements will make it easier and more convenient for you to manage your accounts online. Best of all, there's no action required to take advantage of these updated features. What do I need to know? Important Date -
System changes will take effect on Monday, June 24, 2024 .

Login Challenge Questions - For your security, you may be asked to answer and/or update your security challenge questions. What is changing? Payment Reports - To improve access for reviewing and approving ACH and Wire transactions, the Summary and Detail reports are now available directly from the Payment Center. Account Export functionality - A new Excel export option is now available in the Account Activity, Prior Day, and Current Day pages. Account Views in Account Activity
- To make is easier for viewing transaction activity, a new 'Relative Date' search option will be available allowing the user to select date range parameters. An 'Edit my View' option will also be available so that users may create and save a customer default view of their account transaction history. Recipients for Foreign Currency Wires - To help prevent wires from being rejected, Beneficiary Address Country Code is now required. Users will now have to select the Country/Region for their recipients from a drop-down menu. Previously, users had to enter the Country/Region manually as part of the address line. Bank Security Alerts for Non-admin Users - To assist in managing user updates, non-admin / sub users can now enroll for bank security alerts pertaining to online banking profile changes. Removal of USD Wire Transfers Options - Remittance Information Option will be removed on free form or templates for USD Wires. Remittance Information that was previously applied will be removed. If you have any remittance information you need to carry over, you can move the information to the 'Details of Payments' field prior to the upgrade. Order Customer Option will be removed on all wire payment types. Information entered in 'Senders Reference Field' will no longer be included in outgoing wire messages. Mobile App Updates: For added convenience, users can now create ACH and Wire payments from an approved template. Biometric Opt Out Option - Users will now have the option to disable the biometrics (Face ID / Fingerprint) for Mobile App login.
Additional important information To ensure wire payments are processed accurately and efficiently , we encourage you to include complete beneficiary name and address along with any additional payment information (ex. invoice number, types of goods/services purchased). This information can be included under the ""Details of Payment"" field on the wire form. USD International Wires Intermediary Banks - We currently have several preferred Intermediary Banks, including Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, and BNY Mellon. For your convenience, we always include one as a default, and recommend saving them in your 'Preferred Bank List' in the Payment Center. The Intermediary Bank may convert your USD international wire into local currency. If you are sending the wire to a beneficiary with a USD Account and do not want the funds auto converted to the local currency, please put ""DO NOT CONVERT"" in the OBI/Details of Payment field. Below you will find a User Guide that will help you understand the required data that is specific to the country where the wire is being sent, and details about the Intermediary Bank fee deductions. [<https://preview.eastwestbank.com/bridgeblastresources/Outgoing Wire Instructions and Country Codes_User Guide June 2024_Final.pdf>] What should I do to prepare?

Dear Customer, We're pleased to announce that your online banking platform business Bridge® Premier will soon be updated to include several improvements. These enhancements will make it easier and more convenient for you to manage your accounts online. Best of all, there's no action required to take advantage of these updated features. What do I need to know? Important Date -
System changes will take effect on Monday, June 24, 2024 . Same Login and Account Settings - All online banking settings will remain unchanged, including accounts, services, users, and all ACH and Wire Payment information (if applicable). Login Challenge Questions - For your security, you may be asked to answer and/or update your security challenge questions. What is changing? Payment Reports - To improve access for reviewing and approving ACH and Wire transactions, the Summary and Detail reports are now available directly from the Payment Center. Account Export functionality - A new Excel export option is now available in the Account Activity, Prior Day, and Current Day pages. Account Views in Account Activity
- To make is easier for viewing transaction activity, a new 'Relative Date' search option will be available allowing the user to select date range parameters. An 'Edit my View' option will also be available so that users may create and save a customer default view of their account transaction history. Recipients for Foreign Currency Wires - To help prevent wires from being rejected, Beneficiary Address Country Code is now required. Users will now have to select the Country/Region for their recipients from a drop-down menu. Previously, users had to enter the Country/Region manually as part of the address line. Bank Security Alerts for Non-admin Users - To assist in managing user updates, non-admin / sub users can now enroll for bank security alerts pertaining to online banking profile changes. Removal of USD Wire Transfers Options - Remittance Information Option will be removed on free form or templates for USD Wires. Remittance Information that was previously applied will be removed. If you have any remittance information you need to carry over, you can move the information to the 'Details of Payments' field prior to the upgrade. Order Customer Option will be removed on all wire payment types. Information entered in 'Senders Reference Field' will no longer be included in outgoing wire messages. Mobile App Updates: For added convenience, users can now create ACH and Wire payments from an approved template. Biometric Opt Out Option - Users will now have the option to disable the biometrics (Face ID / Fingerprint) for Mobile App login.
Additional important information To ensure wire payments are processed accurately and efficiently , we encourage you to include complete beneficiary name and address along with any additional payment information (ex. invoice number, types of goods/services purchased). This information can be included under the ""Details of Payment"" field on the wire form. USD International Wires Intermediary Banks - We currently have several preferred Intermediary Banks, including Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, and BNY Mellon. For your convenience, we always include one as a default, and recommend saving them in your 'Preferred Bank List' in the Payment Center. The Intermediary Bank may convert your USD international wire into local currency. If you are sending the wire to a beneficiary with a USD Account and do not want the funds auto converted to the local currency, please put ""DO NOT CONVERT"" in the OBI/Details of Payment field. Below you will find a User Guide that will help you understand the required data that is specific to the country where the wire is being sent, and details about the Intermediary Bank fee deductions. [<https://preview.eastwestbank.com/bridgeblastresources/Outgoing Wire Instructions and Country Codes_User Guide June 2024_Final.pdf>] What should I do to prepare? Prior to the upgrade: If you have any payment remittance information in existing templates that you need to carry over, please move the information to the 'Details of Payment' field, lines 1-4.
Share this information with all your company users. Review the enclosed Key Changes document for detailed information about these updated features. Visit our [Business Training Center <https://www.eastwestbank.com/en/small-mid-size-businesses/training-center>]
to access all our online banking training resources, should you need it. [<https://preview.eastwestbank.com/bridgeblastresources/BBP_6.10_Upgrade_Key Changes_FINAL_6_13_24.pdf>] We're confident that these changes will enhance your overall online banking experience.

Good evening Daniel,



My name is Tyler and I’m one of Jericho Security’s corporate counsel at WSGR. It’s great to meet you!



We’ve attached here YC’s standard form of pro rata side letter. Please let us know if this form works on your end.



We’ve also attached a summary of the company’s cap table. One percent of the company’s 11M fully diluted shares comes out to 110,000 shares. We’ll update your grant accordingly in the advisor agreement.



The company is in the process of wrapping up it’s SAFE financing. Once the company has completed its raise, we’ll commission a new 409A valuation to determine the fair market value of the shares. At this point, the board can grant your
options.



Would you mind providing the signature block information for your SAFE? If everything else is in order, we can circulate documents for signatures whenever you’re ready to proceed.



Best,

Hope this email finds you thriving in your business pursuits. I wanted to
circle back and shed light on a common pain point we all face – the
never-ending battle with accounting complexities.

Ever considered the immense value of outsourcing? Let me share some
eye-opening stats with you. According to a study by Clutch, 70% of
businesses experienced significant cost savings by outsourcing their
accounting needs. Another study by Xero found that businesses saved an
average of 11 hours per week by outsourcing bookkeeping.

Now, imagine those hours reclaimed for strategic business decisions rather
than crunching numbers.

Fusion Business Solutions Private Limited (FBSPL) is your ideal partner in
this transformative journey. Our diverse skillsets, flexibility with all
cloud-based accounting software, and custom automation solutions set us
apart. Imagine the peace of mind that comes with accurate financial records
and a team dedicated to optimizing your processes.

These differentiators aren't just promises – they're the backbone of our
commitment to simplifying your accounting.

Curious to explore how outsourcing with FBSPL can elevate your business?
Let's hop on a call to delve deeper into your unique needs and how our
tailored solutions can make a tangible difference.

10613,bcc_email_sec_inbound,sarah.darlington@a8n-group.com,"Hi Sage - Over the last two years, companies have thrown more resources
than ever before into prospecting for new business - but is it working?
Working with a lead gen company is a little intimidating - empty promises,
a funnel full of bad leads, and no real accountability. We are different!

At Acceler8now, we have solutions that use intent data and email marketing
to capture the 3% of people when they are actively searching for solutions
like yours (or your competition!) - then we nurture the 97% until they are
ready to engage. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to consistently reach out
to them every day and capture them whilst they are actually looking?

Our solutions do that. Yes, we can provide you with huge lists of the right
type of contact in any company and send emails to them (and we do that
really well!) - but our intent data solution identifies people looking at
you, your competition, or for solutions like yours, and combines email
automation and human nurturing to stay with your prospects until they are
ready to engage. This is a new, living, breathing way to engage and
interact with hot prospects!.

A quick call is all I ask; it is a great option, we are pretty unique, and
we are cost-effective (way cheaper than Zoom Info) - but if you are already
working with them - we can help you consistently target their data too!

We specialize in prospecting. Every. Single. Day.

If this is intriguing, could we jump on a quick 15 mins call to see if our
thinking aligns? Worst case - we get to swap lead gen horror stories - I
love them.

Look forward to connecting,

Sarah",A meeting request - please

Hi Sage,

Let this sink in: Only 19% of MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by adversaries are covered by enterprise SIEMs. This means 4 out of 5 adversary techniques could go undetected, leaving your organization vulnerable.

We are excited to announce the release of our 4th annual Report on the State of SIEM Detection Risk (https://cThJm04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/GE+113/cThJm04/MX1n5WJ79ZfW6_ZQM_5h91TNW1HN78y5gtlHSN5d8yQM3lcq-W8wLKSR6lZ3nvW5nlRv12Vm7q4W7w2Z3v41WHvCW8-SPDh4QpZ_1N1Vtmm0jn9MKW4TT1Jt8nfWLlW4CdB1d3DzqWFW1GgNG81S0GLwW2Rs8Hj8-rWpCW2P1hCl6N_v3kW7QHSwC3J9GQRN5bLFXnd9Qm1VjSvvm19spndN2lMQvy3HztlW72DVB-4MBMnKVzy-Dz4tfbSmN5VZ4_ZWkdvLW8HgmpR6sn-Q6W5Y6x403rQ8F8VqwkFy1HNxSLW4dnZLw91gt-mW6P9zHk7fjn9fVyvN8_1DGvR0W3Wf-gZ6Lm0QZW7XRMYS1vS-MQW8jTvs38yLzZ3W5wDgQ992Fd7zW7pyjT91ScthlW1CLGK-5m3GRmf87MKPx04 ) .

Caption:

A seed was humbly planted at the start of the year and what grew from it _surpassed any expectations_ I may have had.

Fifty family members, traveling from all around the world, together for an extended weekend to **reunite across generations and geographies.**

We rented a venue and were together, under one roof, for the four day reunion. T Shirts were made with a family emblem, that was hand drawn and designed by one of the younger family members, inaugurated at this gathering. A videographer was hired for the entire weekend, not knowing what exactly he would be capturing, but knowing it would be worthy of capturing. A chef was hired to cook on-site for the group, _including the no less than_ twelve family members who had dietary allergies that needed to be catered for.

Baby photos were printed of all fifty family members participating in the reunion. Hanging on the wall, the black and white prints were numbered and we were asked to guess who’s who. I expected the older relatives, especially those who I’ve heard say for years _‘I was there when you were born’ _would be able to guess every photo. I was wrong. They struggled with a few, including a moment of comedy when a father didn’t recognize his own daughter’s baby photo.

A time capsule became a joint project. Photos were printed, from before I was born to ones of the reunion. Craft paper and felt tip pens were handed out and everyone wrote cards and letters, to their future selves and our family in the future. _It was decided we would open the time capsule ten years from now in 2034._

The highlight was skits. Prompts were written down by hand on scraps of paper, thrown into a bag, and groups of five to six people picked a prompt and were given a few minutes to develop and then act out a scene. **They were so bad that we could not stop laughing.** 

It occurred to me while watching my family members act out in made up scenes in front of an audience of fifty, so casually and calmly, that **we all really did feel secure and safe in this space**. It can be vulnerable, to speak let alone act, in front of a group this large. _Everyone did it with a smile and it seemed like, without breaking a sweat._

In the in-between moments, the family opted for playing cards, sitting and chatting, and of course, eating. The dining area seemed always full of people, with snacks in between meals and the food running out everytime. The chef had no idea how my family uses food as a **source of connection, entertainment and activity.**

Throughout the weekend, I found myself in 1-1 conversations with family members I don’t get to see or interact with regularly. With the familiarity of family, we would go deep really fast and I got to tap into people’s experiences on a variety of topics. Be it investing in the stock market, raising kids, charity work and more. **I appreciated the bank of knowledge available to me unfiltered and unfettered.** It has always been a real asset that I have come to rely on regularly.

For the last evening, we all dressed up. The toddlers in cute frocks and bowties, the women in dresses and the men in shirts and blazers. The sun started to shine through the clouds just as we stepped onto the terrace to take family photos. It took nearly one hour to capture the combinations of family, based on relation, location, generation and more. _And of course, everyone became an overnight director, which was fun to watch and maybe less fun for our photographer._

Later that evening, gag awards were given out, highlighting the memorable moments and inside jokes that made the reunion so special and fun. Followed by a full-on dance party, with everyone participating, regardless of age or ability. It was a magical moment to experience, in an environment that feels so safe and one where we all feel special.

On the last morning, we gathered blurry eyed after a late night, for one final group picture. As everyone said bye, I became teary eyed as I felt how special this experience was for me. **This group of people have shaped me, in ways I’m both aware of and will never be aware of.** I am who I am, how I am, for better or worse, thanks to this family that I grew up in. 

As we grow older, people move around the world, it becomes harder to feel connected to each other. It was grounding to feel connected to my roots, in such a loving and caring way. I feel so grateful for my family and these experiences remind me of how special this connection is in my life. 

And that is how I learned to family.

Let’s talk TV ads.
We asked marketers: 
What gives you the advertising “ick”?
The answers are in.
Who knew three simple questions could tell us where marketers’ heads are at? We were curious to learn why some ads turn people off — and what drives marketers to create more ads (or not).

The findings from this month’s poll have wrapped, and we’ve included a few from the full report below. Be sure to dive into the rest of the insights and see how your picks fared against your peers’.
Seeing the Same Ad Too Often Irks Advertisers:
The largest majority of our respondents said that “excessive repetition (ad fatigue)” turns them off. This was followed by “inauthenticity” and “it doesn’t resonate (aka bad audience targeting).”
When It Comes to Creating Ads, Budget Is the Top Concern.
If you’re a marketer — or really, if you’ve ever spoken to a marketer — this response likely isn’t surprising. Here’s how the top three rounded out (read the report to see the full list):

With more responsibility comes more pressure, but there's a lot to learn from others' success.

A lot of business owners don’t believe Digital Ready’s courses,
 one-on-one coaching, networking events and other resources are free.

 These are the FAQs we hear the most:

 Will you charge me later?
 No. Everything on Digital Ready is, and always will be, free.

 Do I need to be a Verizon customer?
 Also no. Anyone can register (for free) and learn (for free).

 Are you trying to sell me something?
 A third no. While Digital Ready members do get great offers,
 you never have to buy a thing.

 Still don’t buy it? See for yourself (no buying required).

11535,bcc_email_sec_inbound,tina@10x-management.com," Hey Daniel,

If Jericho Security has taken a more cautious approach to hiring in light
of economic uncertainty but still wants to complete tasks and make
product/feature improvements, then the freelance talent market may be a
good place to start.

Here’s how 10x works:

   1. You tell us about a project or work that you need done or a role you
   are struggling to fill. We work best with one-off projects, specific
   deliverables, ongoing hourly work, part-time contracts, and full-time
   contingencies.
   2. 10x will consider your needs and the skills required, and ask any
   relevant questions about the project/role.
   3. 10x will immediately match the right tech freelancer/team from our
   exclusive, vetted roster to the position.

Would love to connect to discuss how 10x talent can boost your business.

Thanks,
Tina

Hi Daniel,

Hiring a full time software engineer can take 6 months or longer before the
new employee walks through the door. At 10x Management, we’ve placed
experienced, vetted freelance tech talent on various projects in as little
as 48 hours with forward-thinking companies.

There’s a reason we’ve been so successful for over a decade in the “renting
talent” space. We’re providing businesses immediate access to some of the
best contract tech talent in the world to move quickly and get work done.

I’d love to have a quick chat to discuss any potential needs/challenges you
might be addressing in case we’re able to help. Do you have 15 minutes this
week or early next to connect?

Thanks,
Tina

I've recently become an advisor for a cybersecurity tool named Jericho Security, which I believe could be service offerings for your clients. It features effective tools, such as a spear phishing simulator, training videos on demand, and email security solutions—a comprehensive package to address the growing number of cyber threats we see today.
I would like to introduce to you Sage Wohns CEO of Jericho Security. I feel it would be worthwhile for you and your team to have a brief demo for you to experience its capabilities firsthand with Sage and team. I think it could be highly advantageous for your team and something your clients could benefit from in their security portfolio.
If this is of interest, please let Sage know some availabilities, and they can arrange for a walkthrough of the solution.

If you filed for the employee retention tax credit program and you’re still waiting to be sent the checks, this could interest you.

The program is still paused, and it's difficult to know for sure when they’ll start paying claims again, leaving anyone that has filed in the last 6 months with a 1 year (or longer) wait time for checks.

If you are still waiting and would like get your money in two weeks, we are willing to purchase your claim for 75c on the dollar and we will wait out the eventual arrival of the employee retention tax credit refund.

12152,bcc_email_sec_inbound,koop@kalndrapp7010.com,"Hi *Sage*,

I'm reaching out as someone who's been following *Jericho Security*'s
impressive journey, particularly with your recent 3 million pre-seed
funding round to develop AI-powered phishing simulation software. It's
exciting to see your innovative approach to cyber security training for
employees. A similar case study that comes to mind is a client we've worked
with in the past, a fellow leader in the AI-powered security space. After
implementing our risk management and compliance solutions, they reported a
significant reduction in security breaches and improved overall risk
fitness.

I'd love to discuss how * Koop
<https://kalendar.ai/chat/private/PDp7CIiu9sI/ofIjT4ojW94?pos=invitation>*'s
AI-driven risk management platform can help Jericho Security navigate the
evolving threat landscape. Our platform has already helped numerous
companies streamline compliance, implement risk controls, and report risk
fitness using advanced algorithms. In fact, some of our clients have seen a
reduction in insurance premiums by up to 30%. I'd be happy to elaborate on
the benefits and share some compelling results from our previous
engagements.

If you're interested in exploring how Koop can support Jericho Security's
growth, I'd be delighted to set up a meeting to discuss further. Please
click this link *[Attachment] Jericho Security material
<https://kalendar.ai/chat/private/PDp7CIiu9sI/ofIjT4ojW94?pos=invitation>*
to schedule a convenient time. With over 174+ similar companies already
reviewing our solutions, I'm confident that Jericho Security will find our
expertise valuable in their quest for cybersecurity excellence.

Wishing you a great week ahead!",Jericho Security — Koop

I wanted to reach back out because if you would like to use your anticipated refund now and not in the future this will interest you. 

We are willing to purchase your ERC claim for 75c on the dollar, and you could get your money within two weeks.

If you’ve already gotten your ERC checks just reply “received”.

Can I tell you more about this? Could I send over some more info?


Thanks,
Joe

Kaspersky Faces Sanctions from U.S. Treasury Soon After Ban

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

U.S. Treasury Sanctions 12 Kaspersky Executives Amid Software Ban
*What happened:* The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has *sanctioned* ( https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2420 ) twelve senior executives at Kaspersky Lab. The Department of Commerce also banned Kaspersky Lab and its affiliates from providing cybersecurity products in the U.S., citing national security risks and ties to Russian intelligence.
*Why it matters:* The sanctions block all property and interests of designated individuals and entities within the United States or controlled by U.S. persons. They also set precedents for foreign institutions engaging in significant transactions with the Russian military-industrial sector, thereby serving as a warning to entities actively facilitating or enabling activities that could compromise national security. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, Russia has criticized the U.S. sales ban on Kaspersky software, calling it a typical effort to stifle foreign competition in favor of American products. However, Kaspersky has maintained its stance of not being associated with the Russian government.

CDK Global Outage Reportedly Caused by BlackSuit Ransomware Attack
*What happened:* BlackSuit ransomware gang has been observed to be behind the recent CDK Global cyber incidents. The company is reportedly in talks with the gang to receive a decryptor and prevent associated data leaks as well. CDK has suffered two cyber incidents last week and was forced to bring some of its systems offline, including its customer support channels leaving clients with limited support options.
*Why it matters:* After the first breach, CDK Global decided to *rapidly* ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-hacked-again-while-recovering-from-first-cyberattack/ ) restore services after taking them down. Many expressed their concerns that such an action could endanger clients to fresh attacks. These attacks show that a more staggered approach to reviving offline systems may be instrumental in further protecting clients and the company from future attacks. Also, CDK Global is *warning* ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-warns-threat-actors-are-calling-customers-posing-as-support/ ) clients that non-CDK representatives are now contacting them on CDK’s behalf hoping to gain unauthorized access to systems. CDK is advising its clients to refrain from responding to such requests, as they are likely to be made by bad actors to facilitate follow-on attacks.

June 24, 2024
Chinese Hackers Step Up Attacks on Taiwanese Organizations
*What happened:* A Chinese state-sponsored hacking group, known as RedJuliett, intensified its cyberattacks targeting Taiwanese organizations, particularly in government, education, technology and diplomacy sectors. RedJuliett exploited vulnerabilities in SoftEther VPN software to breach the networks of various institutions, including government agencies in multiple countries, universities, and technology companies.
*Why it matters:* These cyberattacks underscore the escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, particularly in light of the new Taiwanese administration's perceived stance on independence. The scale and targets of the attacks suggest strategic interference, potentially aimed at gaining political and economic intelligence. RedJulliet, whose hacking patterns are observed to be similar to those of Chinese state-sponsored groups, has been noted attempting cyberattacks against more than 70 Taiwanese organizations. Earlier this month, *Palau* ( https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20240603/palau-taiwan-china-hack/ ) , one of Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, accused China after it suffered a cyberattack in March with more than 20,000 government documents stolen and later published on the dark web in April.

**Apple is reportedly working on an AI partnership with Meta, which would integrate its AI capabilities into Apple Intelligence.** The deal is not the most obvious melding, as the tech giants have disagreed over Apple's 2021 privacy changes, which Meta said wiped out $10 billion of its revenue in 2022.

Apple is also working with Google on AI integration, as well as startups like Anthropic and Perplexity. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is not even paying OpenAI to put ChatGPT on iPhones.

**Nvidia has signed a deal to deploy its AI technology at data centers owned by Qatari telecoms group Ooredoo in five Middle Eastern countries.** This marks Nvidia's first large-scale launch in a region where Washington has curbed the export of sophisticated U.S. chips to prevent Chinese firms from using Middle Eastern countries as a back door to access AI technology.

The agreement will make Ooredoo the first company in the region to give clients of its data centers in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology. The deal will allow Ooredoo to better help its customers deploy generative AI applications.

AI is driving the development of humanoid robots, with Tesla's Optimus being the most popular. Elon Musk has been optimistic about the robot's future, suggesting it could make Tesla a $25 trillion company. AI, specifically LLMs like ChatGPT, is opening up possibilities for humanoid robots, making them more collaborative, easier to understand commands, and more human-like.

**While ChatGPT has shown promise in making things look functional on the surface, its practical application in homes is still being explored. **Other factors contributing to the popularity of humanoid robots include research by Boston Dynamics and bot applications in factories.

Not enough time to get the most out of Marketo? We know how it is – tight deadlines, overflowing project lists, and always wanting to get more out of Marketo.

AdvancedMD aimed to find and convert more leads, but it needed more bandwidth to improve its lead nurturing and Marketo setup.

We became their go-to Marketo experts, handling lead nurturing and automation. We generated over 2,000 qualified leads per month, and their sales increased by 54% in just one year.

Think of HyperX Marketing as your fractional Marketo experts. We offer flexible plans to work seamlessly as an extension of your team.

Online cap tables aren’t the source of truth—your legal documents are. As we
were transferring Lux-backed founders over to AngelList, we found errors between
the two.


So, we created an AI Tie-Out assistant (the first of its kind) that is
constantly checking your data and sending accuracy reports to you and your law
firm —helping y’all delete errors before they result in millions.


Hundreds of heads of operations are now more compliant and confident in their
equity management.


If you'd like to hear what they are saying, just let me know and I'll share over
some testimonials.

I hope you've been well! I'm sorry for the late notice, but would you by
chance have any other time this week you'd be available to meet? My dog has
been unwell and I'd like to run him over to the vet if I can. No worries if
not, but wanted to check.

There are MANY different ways that being a guest on a podcast can benefit
you. The obvious is tapping into a new audience that contains potential
clients, but have you thought about using podcast audiences to validate a
product or service? Or really work through how you describe what you do?

Here are some happy surprises we've heard from clients around their
experience with being a podcast guest:

   - Guesting on podcasts improved public speaking skills
   - Fine-tuned elevator pitch
   - Validated a new service offering
   - Landed VC money
   - Led quality candidates to apply for employment


We've found the best way to discuss the specific goals for your podcast
tour is with a quick call. Here's a link to my calendar

This past week we **celebrated our 300th issue** of this newsletter & to say ‘thank you’ replaced our typical weekly poll with a $300 gift card… that being said, without a specific topic to dive deep on we decided to instead **introduce two new concepts** to our ecosystem.

# Introducing our ‘Bootstrapping to Billions’ Podcast

We are looking to** host weekly interviews** and **community based** **‘ask me anything’ sessions** with game changers who are **building, buying, and investing in profit-led businesses** & can **help teach / train / equip us **something new to implement on **our own business journey**.

If you are **interested in being interviewed** or know of someone **who can share something of value** — let us know!

Youtube: ‘Bootstrapping to Billions’ (https://youtu.be/AKfsxtz2ZcU?si=fZN-ql_VwTilmsGz)

# Introducing our Community Capital Concept

One of the main reasons **WHY** we launched the [bootstrapper.community](http://bootstrapper.community) several months back was to help build **more meaningful relationships** with more** profit-led business owners** that we can invest in over at [BootstrapperCapital.com](http://BootstrapperCapital.com)

That being said, we are now looking to** explore a new community capital concept** that will help us get more folks involved with our mission of providing the most **affordable & flexible performance based capital **of choice for SMBs.

13199,bcc_email_sec_inbound,nytdirect@nytimes.com,"The Morning: Starbucks and its union
Plus, protests in Kenya, primary elections and “White Chicks” at 20. View in browser|nytimes.com June 26, 2024 Good morning. Today, we’re covering a favorable development for U.S. labor unions as well as protests in Kenya, primary elections and “White Chicks” at 20. At the Starbucks Workers United headquarters in Buffalo, N.Y. Libby March for The New York Times Coffee and a contract By Noam Scheiber  I cover workplace issues and the labor movement. Labor unions have won some big victories in the past few years, including in the auto industry and Hollywood. But if organized labor is going to have a true resurgence in the United States, it can’t simply win raises for workers it already represents. It will need to organize new workers and reverse the decades-long decline in union membership.  That’s why recent events at Starbucks have been so significant. The company and the union which represents more than 400 of Starbucks’s 10,000 U.S. stores appear on track to reach a contract that will cover wages, benefits and disciplinary policies.  This would be a major milestone. Even after workers win a union election, companies often drag their feet when bargaining a contract. If years pass with little or no progress, union supporters may get demoralized and leave, causing the union to unravel.  By contrast, a contract could encourage workers to unionize across Starbucks and other food and beverage chains, which are part of an industry that is overwhelmingly nonunion.  What’s remarkable about the Starbucks development is that it comes after the company spent years resisting the union campaign, which began in Buffalo in 2021. Starbucks’s former chief executive, Howard Schultz, portrayed organizers as outside agitators. He warned employees not to be “distracted” by them.  But in February the two sides announced that they would soon begin hashing out a framework for a contract. What explains the turnaround? In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four key factors. In Seattle, Wash. Grant Hindsley for The New York Times 1. A winning streak. While unions are broadly popular with Americans, they tend to be especially popular among the young and politically progressive, which describes much of Starbucks’s work force.  This made it difficult for Starbucks to contain the union’s growth. The campaign slowed down in mid-2022, when Schultz introduced benefits that did not apply to union stores. But organizers regained momentum as union supporters framed their campaign as a fight for liberal values like L.G.B.T.Q. rights. The union won roughly 100 elections in 2023, which kept the campaign in the news and made it tough for Starbucks to wait it out.  2. A new boss. Schultz, who spent decades at Starbucks before retiring in 2018, returned to the top job in 2022. He focused on fixing operational issues like outdated equipment and store layouts, which he appeared to believe had fueled the union campaign and promised to find a successor quickly. That turned out to be Laxman Narasimhan, the C.E.O. of Reckitt, a consumer products company based in England.  Though little was known about Narasimhan’s feelings on unions at the time, Starbucks corporate officials who worked with him later told me that he took a pragmatic view believing it could be less costly to engage the union than to fight it. His stance differed from that of Schultz, who viewed the union as a personal affront. It appeared to threaten his self-image as a generous boss.  3. External pressure. Socially minded investors pressed Starbucks to commission a report on its labor practices. It found that the company had fallen short of its commitments on labor rights. A coalition of unions spent heavily to back three labor-friendly candidates for seats on Starbucks’s board. And the company became a target of protests and boycotts tied to the war in Gaza, which escalated after Starbucks sued the union over social media posts supportive of Palestinians. In Oakland, Calif. Mike Kai Chen for The New York Times It’s hard to know how much these developments weighed on the company, but Starbucks appeared to take them seriously. It announced a new board committee to oversee employee relations shortly before it released the labor report. The company began talks with the union on how to bargain a contract a few weeks before the scheduled vote on the labor-friendly board candidates. And Narasimhan suggested on an earnings call that the protests and boycotts were having “a negative impact” on business even though they were “driven by misperceptions.”  4. Government help. U.S. labor law is relatively weak: If a company fires an employee for union organizing, the National Labor Relations Board can seek back pay. But it can’t fine the employer. And the process often takes years.  Still, the N.L.R.B. tends to be more active and creative under Democratic administrations. It has been especially active and creative and under President Biden. The board issued more than 100 complaints against Starbucks and went to court to reinstate workers it deemed to have been wrongly fired (though the Supreme Court just reined in this practice). The board even said it would begin ordering unions into existence if an employer’s labor-law violations affected the outcome of a union election.  Though Starbucks consistently denied wrongdoing and appealed findings against it, the board’s actions were another source of pressure that raised the cost of fighting the union.  A programming note: David Leonhardt is off until next week, and other Times journalists will continue writing the newsletter until then. THE LATEST NEWS Primary Elections Jamaal Bowman Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times In New York, George Latimer, a centrist challenger, defeated the progressive congressman Jamaal Bowman.  Bowman is the first of the “squad” an influential group of left-wing House members to lose a seat. Read takeaways.  In Colorado, Lauren Boebert won a crowded Republican primary, nearly guaranteeing she will serve another two years in Congress. More on Politics The judge who presided over Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial ruled that Trump can now criticize the prosecution witnesses.  Oklahoma’s Supreme Court blocked state funding for what would have been the nation’s first religious charter school.  Biden is expected today to pardon around 2,000 veterans convicted of engaging in gay sex, which was outlawed by a military code for more than 60 years.  Biden administration officials urged medical experts to remove age minimums for surgeries from their transgender medical care guidelines, emails show.  In more than 50 years in Washington, Biden has learned to make deals and work across the aisle. It is an old-school instinct rarely rewarded in today’s political climate, Peter Baker writes. Kenya Protesters in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Brian Inganga/Associated Press Crowds of Kenyans stormed their Parliament building and set fire to its entrance in protest against a bill raising taxes.  President William Ruto called the protesters treasonous and deployed the military to quell the demonstration. At least five people were killed, human rights groups said.  The tax bill would raise the price of diapers, eggs and phone data, among other things. Officials say it’s needed to pay off Kenya’s debt.  Auma Obama, a Kenyan British activist who is a half sister of Barack Obama, was tear-gassed as she spoke about her opposition to the bill on CNN. See the video.  Kenya is among Africa’s fastest-growing economies, yet the benefits have not reached many ordinary people. The unrest is a sign of a growing economic crisis across the continent.  On the same day, 400 Kenyan police officers arrived in Haiti which has been plagued by gang violence to restore order. Israel-Hamas War Waiting to receive food in southern Gaza. Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock An international group of experts said nearly half a million people in Gaza were at risk of starvation.  Hamas said a sister of its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli strike on their family home. Haniyeh leads the group from exile in Qatar.  The U.S. and Israeli defense secretaries met in Washington to discuss the intensifying conflict along Israel’s border with Lebanon. Russia The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich went on trial today in Russia on espionage charges. Russia has presented no evidence of his guilt, and the trial is being held in secret.  The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two top Russian security officials over strikes against Ukraine’s power plants. Other Big Stories The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Espionage Act, securing his freedom under a plea deal. He was sentenced to time served in Britain and has returned home to Australia.  A new space race: The U.S. and China are competing to build permanent outposts at the moon’s most strategic location, the lunar south pole, The Wall Street Journal reports. Opinions  What do Biden and Trump need to do to win the presidential debate? The most important thing is to be energetic, say Chris Whipple and Kristen Soltis Anderson.  Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak and five other prominent Israelis urge Congress to disinvite Benjamin Netanyahu from its joint session next month.  Here are columns by Bret Stephens on Jews and the Ivy League and Thomas Edsall on who gains from voting restrictions. Games for relaxation. Games for concentration. We have them all.

 	 9th Annual | Early Bird Application Deadline Tomorrow –
Thursday, June  27

Nominate Your Cloud Security Solutions:
Raise Your Brand Reputation | Reach New Levels of Market Share


Dear Colleague,

It's time to apply for Cloud Computing Magazine and TMCnet's 2024 Cloud
Security Excellence Awards
<https://www.tmcnet.com/tmc/poty/default.aspx?AwardID=677> .

Based on actual client case studies or success stories, these awards
instantly set you apart in a crowded market. Being selected as a winner
proves without a doubt that your solutions are not only ready for
deployment, but proven to solve your client’s cloud security challenges.


*	You’ve helped secure business applications, infrastructure,
services, networks and devices
*	You’ve demonstrated leadership and innovation
*	And you’ve proven that your solutions is effective in minimizing
the evolving threat landscape

>> SPECIAL NOTICE <<
Tomorrow, Thursday, June 27 is the early bird application deadline.
Apply by end of the day tomorrow to save $100 off your professing fee.

Cloud Security Excellence Award winners will be named in two categories.

Cloud-Delivered Security
With the ever-increasing number of hacks and intrusions, ensuring
security of our applications, services, data, and devices has never been
more critical. Virtualization and Cloud Computing – much as they have
for other services – have created a market for security to be delivered
to enterprises via the cloud, thus ensuring a highly scalable and
geographically indiscriminate security solution without increasing the
burden on internal IT. If you are one of those security solutions
leveraging the cloud as your delivery model, this is your chance to
differentiate your offer from your competitors at a time when everyone
should be focused on ensuring their security partners are up to speed.

Cloud Security
For years, one of the chief causes of delay or even rejection of cloud
migration has been security. The notion that critical data is stored in
facilities outside the enterprise’s sphere of control came with a degree
of fear. Even with the reassurances from both the cloud and security
players that security remains a top priority, the knowledge that that
threat matrices are ever-evolving leaves little room for error. If your
product or service is among those keeping cloud infrastructure and
applications secure, ensure you receive the recognition you deserve –
apply today for the Cloud Security Excellence Awards.

This is a solution-level award, so please submit individual applications
and success stories for each worthy product/service.

ITEXPO Expands for 2025

ITEXPO, one of the largest and longest-running technology trade shows in
the United States, recently announced a major expansion for 2025.

After selling out of exhibit space in 2024, ITEXPO 2025 will occupy Expo
Halls A and B – doubling the available exhibit space, and adding
15 new premium meeting rooms for exhibitors and sponsors.

In addition, the ITEXPO conference program has added eight new, larger
breakout rooms to the conference programming. Many sessions
across ITEXPO and its collocated events exceeded their room capacity in
2024. The move to the larger spaces ensures attendees will not
get shut out of their chosen sessions.

Since 1999, ITEXPO has been the annual gathering where enterprise/SMB
technology professionals, MSPs, resellers and other channel
partners, service providers, and solutions providers converge to explore
the latest advancements in communications and technology.

For 2025, the expansion of ITEXPO includes:

*	100% growth in exhibit space
*	Addition of 15 new premium, private meeting spaces for
exhibitors and sponsors
*	Expansion of Generative AI Expo content to two tracks
*	Addition of two new collocated events:

	*	Enterprise Cybersecurity Expo
	*	Intelligent Video Expo

*	Return of popular collocated events:

	*	MSP Expo
	*	Future of Work Expo
	*	Future of CX Expo
	*	Enterprise Metaverse Expo
	*	IoT Evolution Expo

Facing a cybersecurity workforce shortage amidst new threats to national security, government agencies are more vulnerable than ever before. <https://link.govexec.com/click/35851029.101260/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292ZXhlYy5jb20vc3BvbnNvci1jb250ZW50L0FUVC1OYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS1uZXR3b3JrLW1vZGVybml6YXRpb24tYnJpbmdzLXVuaXF1ZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLz9vcmVmPW5nZmN3X2Z0dF9ubA/65c10fd84754d15f021122cbFceb3c836>

New technologies have brought high rewards, but perhaps even higher risks. With IT worker shortages spanning across all sectors, government agencies are focusing on the mission while contracting with experts to manage their networks. By developing relationships with industry leaders, national security agencies are able to focus on the mission without having to worry about heightened security concerns, new regulations, compliance issues, and outdated systems that no longer work.

I never heard back from you, would you mind sharing how much time your team spends working on security assessments?
If the answer is anytime at all, I'd really love for you to check out TrustHub. Our tool can help fill out assessments in seconds versus hours or days. Our pricing is also super straight forward and transparent, $99 a month.
Let me know if you'd like me to show you around the tool before signing up.

Hey Madison,


Quick question - how long does your team spend on filling out vendor assessments?


I'm going to guess a lot of time based off my previous experience as a VP of Sales. That's why I built TrustHub, an AI powered tool that allows you to fill out vendor/security assessments in minutes versus days. We help sales team save 20+ hours per month filling out vendor assessments.


The way it works is quite simple, you load your account with previously completely assessments and you and our AI can fill out new assessments for you in seconds using your knowledgeable of Q&A's.


We are running promotion for only $99 a month and you can cancel at anytime. SIGN UP HERE.


Let me know if you have any questions!

June 2024

This month, we’ve got Coda Brain—our new
turnkey AI platform—on the brain. And we can’t stop wondering
about the ways AI will change the way we work together. You could
say we’ve got a one-track mind, but let’s not overdo the puns.

​

So, here’s a roundup of all our favorite AI takes, templates,
and thinking this month, from great minds in and outside of Coda.

Hi Sage,


Pardon the email interruption. I wanted to reach out about sales development execution at Jericho Security.


We're a boutique sales development firm following the Account-Based model for highly targeted campaigns in tech markets like Jericho Security's.


In today's market, building pipeline for emerging tech requires a high-quality approach and industry-experienced SDRs. I have a handful of reps and personally manage all of our campaigns, bringing a decade of experience working with startup to large tech companies as a sales leader.


Hoping to introduce our agency to you as a premium pipeline building resource for the future. Are you perhaps available to chat next week?

Let's Modify Your Metadata!

Hi Dan ,

At Pieces for Developers, we know that managing and referencing your saved code snippets should be a seamless experience. That's why we've created different ways for you to access your personal Pieces repository with features designed to enhance your workflow and organization.

 

1. Reference your Code with Ease: List View vs. Gallery View

 

* List View: Optimized for quick browsing, our list view allows you to sort your snippets in various ways * Recent: Chronological by most recently added.
* Suggested: Chronological by most recently added.
* Alphabetical by Title: Chronological by most recently added.
* Alphabetical by Language: Chronological by most recently added.
* Gallery View: Ideal for viewing large code snippets in detail.
 

By switching between these views, you can find exactly what you need without any hassle.

 

2. Auto-Enrich your Code with Context and Metadata

* Title + Description: Quickly understand what a snippet does without having to open it.
* Tags: Find your materials faster in search with tags that categorize and identify code snippets.
* Related Links: Learn more about a snippet or revisit the origin website you saved it from.
* Related People: Keep track of collaborators on each snippet. This data keeps your copilot informed on organization roles!
* Sensitive Information: Save snippets without worrying about API keys, personal information, and more. We’ll flag it and notify you before sharing!
* Custom Metadata: Add, edit and delete any context and metadata attached to your code snippets - you have complete control.
3. Amplify your Collaboration with Cloud Integrations and Personalized Shareable Links

* GitHub Gists Integration ( https://docs.pieces.app/product-highlights-and-benefits/saving-to-and-from-github-gists?utm_campaign=Welcome+3.0&utm_content=%283%29+Explore+your+Pieces+Repository&utm_medium=transactional&utm_source=customerio ): Import saved snippets or share new snippets in Pieces as Gists directly.
*
Microsoft Teams Integration ( https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/teams?utm_campaign=Welcome+3.0&utm_content=%283%29+Explore+your+Pieces+Repository&utm_medium=transactional&utm_source=customerio ): Discover and save snippets right from your Teams chats.
*
Custom Pieces Subdomain ( https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing?utm_campaign=Welcome+3.0&utm_content=%283%29+Explore+your+Pieces+Repository&utm_medium=transactional&utm_source=customerio ): Claim your custom subdomain to send personalized shareable links. Each link contains your code and AI-enriched context and metadata, improving collaboration efficiency.

At Pieces for Developers, we strive to make every aspect of your coding experience smooth and efficient. We hope you take full advantage of these features, designed to boost your productivity and facilitate collaboration.
