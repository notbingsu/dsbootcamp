Once your teams open enrollment has started, we will be unable to make changes to your benefits package and your next opportunity to make changes will be during your groups renewal next year.All benefits eligible employees will receive an email from Gusto the morning open enrollment begins.

You can track your teams progress in the Benefits tab of your Gusto admin account.If your employees have questions on how to complete the process in Gusto they can reach out to our Care team using the Help tab in their Gusto profile.Note: In order to make sure your group's coverage is submitted to the carriers and approved timely, we aim to keep a short open enrollment window. If employees are unable to complete enrollment before the deadline, we will extend it on a case-by-case basis. If you'd like to make a change to your open enrollment dates, please let me know before open enrollment begins.Notes about your policies:You cover employees working a minimum of 30 hours per week.Coverage for new hires begins 1st of the month after hire.Let me know if you have any questions about the items above or the benefits renewal process.

Hey Sage,

It’s been a while since we last got together. How’ve you been?

I’m reaching out because our CISO, Mark Sutton, was interested in what you’re building and wanted to learn more about the offering. I’m not sure if you’re onboarding new customers currently, but Mark leads our global security program (1500+ employees) as well as that of many of our companies’. Mark’s in town this week for RSA in case you are too and want to meet in person. Otherwise, I’ll let you guys chat over Zoom!

Dear Mohamad Iyan Danial,

Navigating supply chain risks and preempting problems ahead of time may seem straightforward in theory. But how do you implement best practices in reality?

Join FiscalNote Global Intelligence for a hands-on masterclass, where our specialists will workshop the mapping and forecasting of supply chain risks for a fictional company. During this simulation, they will follow a three-step process which you can implement in your own organisation. Watch as they:

Watch as our specialists:

- Analyse a map of the fictional company’s supply chain, demonstrating how to spot critical points of failure, fine-tune the map and differentiate between different types of risk
- Detect risk events in real-time, showing you how to do so even if you are not data-savvy
- Identify red flags for potential future risk, based on anomalous research patterns and changes in sentiment and trends

The masterclass will take place on Tuesday, 21 May, at 1100hrs Washington DC / 1600hrs London / 1700hrs Paris.

We look forward to you joining us. Please note that places are limited and preference will be given to clients of FiscalNote Global Intelligence companies, which comprise Dragonfly, Oxford Analytica and FrontierView.

Confirmation emails for the live session with unique joining details will come from updates@fiscalnote.com. Please ensure that this address is on your safe list to avoid confirmations being rejected as spam.

Yours,

Josh Haecker

bcc_email_sec_inbound,chip@lead2pipeline.com,"Hi Mads, (Sage / Iyan, nice to virtually meet you both as well).

Great speaking with you and love hearing the positive news and results that you shared.

As mentioned,  here is the ICP info we used on the previous program.  I will update the company size to 1k-5k as discussed, any other changes you would like to make?


Campaign Details - Middle and Bottom of Funnel

Here is our ICP:

Industries: Finance, Healthcare & Pharma, Manufacturing, Retail, Utilities, Higher Education

Employee Count: 500 employees - 3,500 employees

Job Titles: CSO, CIO , Chief Risk Officer, Deputy CISO, Management Level: Manager, Director, VP of IT, VP Cyber Security, Director of Cyber Security, Global Security Awareness and Training Manager

Your previous program was for 150 leads for a total of $22,500.  Doubling this to 300 leads would still be the same CPL so the total would be $45,000.
It would be best to process paperwork ASAP so that we can have the leads flowing by the time your BDR / SDR bootcamp completes.
Please ping me with questions,
Chip

Hi there,

Jericho Security and FiscalNote Global Intelligence are pleased to invite you to a webinar looking at how superpowers will adopt and use AI, and what this means for businesses.

This will take place on Tuesday, May 18, 2024, at 0800hrs Los Angeles / 1100hrs Washington DC / 1600hrs London / 1700hrs Paris / 2000hrs Dubai.

In this webinar – conducted with our friends at FiscalNote Global Intelligence – we will discuss the close connection between geopolitical events, actors, and AI threats. Superpower nations like the US and China are rapidly developing and adopting these technologies across multiple domains. These technologies are driving conflict and are used to disrupt businesses in ways that are not always immediately obvious. Many organizations struggle to adapt to the changing threat landscape. So how can businesses build up their resilience to state-powered cyber threats and how can defenders use AI tools to fend off these attacks?

We will cover:

- The evolving AI capabilities of state actors - How superpowers are already using AI and what’s coming next
- How these technologies are driving conflict - From deepfake election disinformation to AI-powered warfare
- The threats AI superpowers pose to businesses and what sectors are at most risk
- Top tips for building cyber resilience -  so your organization stays one step ahead of the hackers
- How you can use AI to boost your cyber defenses against AI-enabled threat actors

Hey there!

Everybody says “Leverage customer feedback to understand what they want and need.” But what exactly do they mean by feedback? Also, how do you gather it and where do you start?

Well, you're likely already familiar with direct and indirect methods of gathering feedback. So we're gonna talk about the third approach—inferred feedback.

Unlike the direct and indirect feedback, inferred feedback doesn’t come directly from customer comments or surveys. Instead, it involves analyzing user behavior on your website to gain insights into their satisfaction and preferences—without them saying a word.

Here’s how you can gather inferred feedback with:

This type of feedback is important in identifying areas of user interest, confusion or frustration, helping you optimize your website for a better user experience.

🔥Mouseflow can generate 6 types of heatmaps (https://cCjyY04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/ZS+113/cCjyY04/VWs6gF8R04g1N1dmhnzhdl1fW2F3lfm5fpbxgN3V8l9W3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3l0W7tVC6l1ZB1gYW7ZVps25Bq0_GW5MT99b4tySvdW5c9jgc2gb8gdW8QYbfx5RKBDLW94yfk24xPP2nW6sZtQC4w3YmcW4BF-tp6RCQGKW920dTB3nDHmgVr6ldm6NB93mN419t1jcck9yW64hwmK9kmhZzW6npZWJ8PPPb2W2xxcl01KDKHhW53pWSZ6YV3lXVxcHRH7Smm5xW6grQYv6cmVxgW2LMtJL1hdJwxW7gNLpl64h0yhW6_S-Vv2G0BpMN3N2Ytqx9C1JW3bYnYm6TphxFW98-tQX39NKR0W73PCyq5T8C6TW51LtjW6TZx0hVvwQf-2Z9GRDVN0Ykk7lXHCLW8yttcR8P6xchf5Q4xW004 ) for all pages on your website.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,joohoyeo@stanford.edu,"Hi Sage,

I had a great call with James yesterday. I'm trying to incorporate some of
his input into the whitepaper.
Given they have only used the Jericho product for one phishing campaign, I
think most of the quotes from him will be on the larger security problems
that he has seen in the industry. He also gave some feedback to about the
product, which I will document separately!

I'm hoping to have it for you guys by Tuesday after the long weekend. Can
we schedule a time next week for a final review?

Best,
JooHo",Re: James?

Great to meet you today.

We're excited for you to participate in our *Cyber Founders Panel *on
Thursday, June 13th at 10:30am-12:00pm. Our office address is 127 West 26th
St., 5th Floor.

At your earliest convenience, can you send me a short bio of yourself? I
will use this to introduce you.

Attached are the one-pagers of our 5 cybersecurity companies coming in from
Spain.

Lastly, the questions haven't been finalized yet, but below are the
questions we used for previous Founders Panels:

   - *What inspired you to create your startup? What problem were you
   aiming to solve?*
   - *What are the biggest challenges you faced in scaling your startup and
   some of the key lessons you've learned in the process?*
   - *What strategies have you found most effective in selling cyber
   solutions? What partnership models do you utilize?*
   - *How have you balanced focusing on what investors want vs. what your
   customers want, and has this changed after reaching certain revenue or
   investment targets? *
   - *What advice would you give to founders seeking top talent in NYC? *


Looking forward to it,

ZeroFox Intelligence Flash Report - NATO Data Leak Shared on Deep Web Forum
*What happened:* On May 19, threat actor “Sumo” announced a data leak pertaining to a NATO school’s e-learning platform on the Russian-speaking deep web forum Cronos.
*Why it matters:* It is likely that the data breach originated from an SQL injection vulnerability that was privately advertised for sale on Telegram in January 2024. The vulnerability allegedly implicated an unknown NATO entity. It is very likely that the intended use of this data is social engineering and other fraudulent activity, with a likely chance it has already been leveraged in attacks by financially-motivated threat actors.

May 23, 2024
Chinese Espionage Group Targets African and Caribbean Governments
*What happened:* China linked cyber espionage threat actor Sharp Panda now being tracked as Sharp Dragon is now targeting Africa and Caribbean government agencies as well. Sharp Dragon is reportedly delivering the Soul modular malware framework which begins with the deployment of the SoulSearcher loader responsible for downloading, decrypting, and executing the Soul backdoor and its other components. This attack method allows the espionage group to gather more information.
*Why it matters:* According to reports, Sharp Dragon has so far confined their cyberespionage campaigns to South Asia, but recently it has upgraded their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gather sensitive data from government agencies and organizations in other countries. China threat actors broadening their attack surface and methodologies shows that they are expanding their cyberespionage campaign globally.

Google Fixes Eighth Actively Exploited Chrome Zero-Day This Year
*What happened:* Google recently issued an emergency security update about the eighth zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2024-5274, detected in its Chrome browser and has been confirmed to be actively exploited in the wild. Google has decided to retain certain information about this vulnerability till a majority of users implement the patch.
*Why it matters:* Google Chrome has over two billion users worldwide exposing many users to exploitation. Users are especially vulnerable as Google has acknowledged four zero-day vulnerabilities in May. Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because they pose an immediate threat to users' security and can lead to successful attacks on victims without any prior warning or time for mitigation.

hubspot.com is authorized to send on behalf of jerichosecurity.com, however it looks like SPF is still failing DMARC’s alignment test. DMARC looks at the Return-Path of a message to make sure the domain there matches the domain in your From address. If the Return-Path path doesn’t match your From address, those messages will fail DMARC’s SPF alignment test. Check with this source because you may need to set up a custom Return-Path.
Other sources These sources are sending emails saying they are from jerichosecurity.com, but we couldn’t verify that they belong to you. It’s important to go through each source and set up SPF and DKIM records for sources that you control. How to identify unknown sources How to fix SPF/DKIM records inkyphishfence.com

Forwarded email sources These sources might be from forwarded emails. The email headers are often preserved when emails are forwarded causing DKIM to pass and SPF to fail DMARC alignment because the From address no longer matches jerichosecurity.com’s SPF record. Generally, there’s nothing to worry about if you already have SPF and DKIM set up on your sources. Learn more about forwarded sources cloud-sec-av.com

bcc_email_sec_inbound,tdinh@broadcasts.lemonsqueezy-mail.com,"Hi everyone 👋

As of 6th July 2024, we are changing our TypingMind Custom pricing structure to better serve our customers and to ensure our long-term sustainability.

The pricing changes only affect new purchases. All existing purchases and subscriptions will continue to be charged at the old pricing.

The pricing changes will take effect starting from 6th July 2024. All purchases made before this date will be charged at the old pricing.

The changes are as follows:

-  Additional Seat License: adding additional seats will now cost $8/seat/month. The first 5 seats are included in the base price of all plans.
-  Starter Plan: The Starter plan will now be limited to 3 AI agents and 3 plugins.
-  Growth Plan: The Growth plan will now be limited to 10 AI agents and 10 plugins.

The complete details of the new pricing are available in our official announcement here.

[View official announcement](https://url4902.broadcasts.lemonsqueezy-mail.com/ls/click?upn=u001.ZwsatdgUS91Fz6f7nWKFiX9pQGQicQpZH-2Fa8hYkbLCwDsQGmaxKJ6CIve-2F5nX2YhgNm-2F53WN13WCD-2FAZILDzRxN8VaWfFuDWXC3Kfux17-2FY-3DoCAC_lPaKrsRq-2FdCynsVg0mITypEoBoAajKPFyQUQQ46mBDrrD4409SBFbnmIINL0SFtF-2B7zJyNO50zHiPMIAyaT6FPeDbZiGg4D3sociz06lIXYPLpHIbqNe-2B-2FWAzHJn-2FxKEwtnMMf4scqGj-2BIDXkqC0IHdeKgNP-2BJ3KbD0sRpR90LJYt-2B8wAdCXD0nHzApxdOkcLahKWYUbQOcGjxuhUvfLUHvIpv-2Bw2cTXePUpyra7KVv9kgZDZ9DRkxh-2F-2BK8IhkaCJe2Rn-2BsR8ZY4BzkYmUGKPLZ-2F1qUZzusB-2BWfRsCSBf1E-3D

Thank you for your continued support!

Frequently Asked Questions

I have purchased some user seats previously as one-time purchases. Will those seats be converted to a subscription?

No, those seats will not be converted to subscriptions. All previously purchased seats will still work as a one-time purchase and will be valid forever. The new pricing is only for new purchases.

If I buy new seats now, will it be a one-time purchase or a subscription?

If you buy new seats before 6th July 2024, there is an option to buy as one-time purchase (you will see the option in the checkout screen). You can choose to pay the new subscription price if you want to but it's not required.

If I buy new seats after 6th July 2024, can I pay the old price as a one-time purchase?

No. After 6th July 2024, all new seat purchases will be subscriptions.

Does this pricing change affect customers who are using the self-host version?

Yes, and the same policy applies: all existing purchases will continue to be charged at the old pricing. The new pricing will only affect new purchases.

I'm currently on the Starter plan, will my account get limited to 3 AI agents and 3 plugins now?

No. If you are already on a plan, the changes will not affect your current subscription. You get unlimeted AI agents and plugins in your account. The new limits will only apply to new purchases.

If I subscribe to the Growth plan now, will I get the old limits or the new limits?

If you subscribe before 6th July 2024, you will get the old limits. The new limits will only apply to new purchases after 6th July 2024.

Why are you changing the seat license to subscription now?

The one-time purchase seat license was offered as a limited-time promotion as a token of appreciation to our early customers. We are now making these changes to ensure our long-term sustainability so that we can better serve our customers. Every new user to the platform increases our costs: servers, database storage, bandwidth, customer support, and more. The subscription model will help us cover these costs and continue to provide a great service for all of our customers while keeping the platform up-to-date with the latest developments in the fast-moving AI space.

Do you offer volume discounts for large purchases?

Yes. Please contact us at support@typingmind.com for a quote.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,reese@t1.co,"Hi Dan,

We just had a call with Ya-Rong. Her feedback for the new offer is
positive, as she found it quite attractive, so after some consideration,
she decided to accept it and she will resign after receiving the official
offer letter from T1.

The only potential risk we anticipate would be her current company try to
retain her with a higher salary or guilt trip her. Hence we've also tried
our best to prepare her on how to handle the possible scenarios. (We asked
her to not share the new offer amount to avoid conter-offer from her
current company, and asked her to make it as clear as possible to her
manager that she has made up her mind and hopes for nothing but their
blessing)
After she receives the offer letter, we will also closely monitor her
status throughout the resignation process and keep you posted.

We will prepare the updated offer letter ASAP, could you kindly confirm
whether the attached is all correct before I send it out to Ya-Rong?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPLLLig0bPWv7AslTKwfjpIXEQj-UH-920CaidYTX2M/edit

(I manually adjusted the salary compensation from 1.85M to 2M TWD/yr).

Once Dan confirms, @Jennifer Chan (T1) <jennifer@t1.co>, can you please
send the official offer to Ya-Rong?

Best regards,
Reese",Re: Ya-Rong Follow-Up

Hi Mohamad Iyan Danial,

Since the arrest of then-President Pedro Castillo on 7 December 2022, Peru has been beset by civil unrest.

Last year, our client wanted to know whether it would be safe for them to hold a major festival in the country in 2024. Would some locations be riskier than others? What was the probability that the protests would still be ongoing, and how disruptive might they prove to the festival?

To answer such questions, which were part of their long-term planning process, a general view of the geopolitical situation was not enough. The organisation needed a customised view of the risks and implications for their specific situation.

That’s where FiscalNote Global Intelligence Advisory services help.

BOOK A CONSULTATION: https://pages.fiscalnote.com/Advisory-Enquiry.html

Whether you are organising an event, entering or exiting a new market, launching a new product or considering any other kind of change, we can create scenarios looking at how a specific geopolitical flashpoint might develop.

These are bespoke to you, based on a set of assumptions that are unique to your organisation and take into account your business model, goals and strategies.

As our client with the Peru event found, the result is to make your planning process more focused and effective, with a narrow set of concrete scenarios to discuss rather than a multitude of hazy possibilities. It’s more proactive, too, as you can initiate conversations with senior decision-makers about how they might respond should some of the more alarming scenarios come to pass.

If that’s the kind of long-term planning process you want as well, please get in touch with our specialists today.

There are plenty of factors to consider when choosing to replace an aging piece of software, however, inaction is not a sustainable option for growing businesses.
Tune in to this webinar for an analysis of two well-known ERP vendors: NetSuite and Microsoft. We will compare NetSuite’s feature set to Microsoft’s legacy on-premise offerings and briefly demo NetSuite's ERP. You’ll also hear NetSuite customers share why they chose to leave Microsoft’s aging platform.
In this demo learn how to:
*                                                                                                                                  Support growth: NetSuite’s constantly evolving platform receives stress-free biannual updates, helping ensure that your modern business needs are met for years to come.

We’ve selected this upcoming event just for you:

CFO’s New Approach to KPIs
Tuesday, May 28 | 11:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. PT
On their own, KPIs don’t always tell the story of where your organization needs to go and how to get there. To get the desired outcome, the context and behavioral motivation—targets and incentives—are often as critical as the KPI metric itself. Used in connection with effective OKRs (Objective Key Results), targets and incentives have the power to drive extraordinary achievement when designed correctly.
Join us for a discussion with Bernie Smith, author of “GAMED: Why Targets and Incentives Fail and How to Fix Them” as we explore practical examples and case studies, shedding light on the essential steps for designing robust, effective, and credible targets and incentives for organizations.

Dear Valued Customer,

 We are reaching out to inform you of an important update related to our billing practices, specifically regarding the collection of sales tax. In line with evolving tax regulations and our commitment to compliance, we will begin collecting sales tax on transactions in states where our services are considered taxable. This change reflects our dedication to adhering to state tax laws and regulations, ensuring that we continue to provide you with high-quality service while meeting our legal obligations.

 What This Means for You:
 Starting from July 1, 2024, sales tax will be applied to your subscription fees as you are located in one of the states where Software as a Service is considered taxable.

 Please note that the applicable sales tax rate will vary by state and locality. This additional charge will be reflected on your invoice, and you will be able to view the detailed tax calculations for full transparency.

 No Action Required:
 There is no immediate action required on your part. Our billing system will automatically update to include the necessary sales tax for your next billing cycle. We recommend reviewing your billing address to ensure accuracy and prevent any potential billing discrepancies.

 Our Commitment:
 At Docker, we continually strive to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements, ensuring we deliver exceptional service while maintaining transparency with our valued customers.

 We understand that changes in billing
can be concerning. Please rest assured that we are committed to making this transition seamless. Our team is here to support you and answer any questions you may have regarding this update.

 For further information or any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support team at hub.docker.com/support/contact <https://em.docker.com/NzkwLVNTQi0zNzUAAAGTbxKsuBAO-p18TmpQKqmiEUwf5CKtwuKzg9B1h1sFrdLafSHTP3K0IlZk6bxwRiwsb5sUHUQ=>. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we make these necessary adjustments to comply with state tax laws.

 Thank you for choosing Docker. We look forward to continuing to serve you with the quality and dedication you deserve.

 Thank you,

bcc_email_sec_inbound,mike@wingspansolutions.net,"Hi Brian,

I wanted to follow-up and add a little more detail.

In anticipation of the candidate's start on Tuesday, May 27, I was in
contact with him on Friday, May 24, and he let me know that although having
received approval for his OPT on his F-1 Visa, he would still need his
Employment Authorization Document (EAD), so I did message the Jericho team
on Slack on May 24 that he would not be able to start on Tuesday, May 27. I
think this is where communications started breaking down. On Tuesday, Grace
would have been onboarding him, but I received messages in the morning that
the candidate was not responding, and I shared the information about the
delayed start again due to the lack of the EAD card. I was in contact with
the candidate Tuesday evening to verify if the EAD had arrived or not, and
he confirmed that it had not been received, and said he would reach out
when he did receive it.

I think the candidate's mistake was that he was only responding to me
despite the Jericho team directly contacting him on multiple avenues, until
yesterday when he was presented with an ultimatum to directly respond to
the Jericho team or face rescission of his offer letter. He did respond to
the Jericho team with a rather tone-deaf email complaining about interteam
communications, but also providing a status update on the arrival of his
EAD.

For context, I am a contractor working with Jericho and am helping them
facilitate their hiring, so that is my role in this and why I have been a
middle-man.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Mike

ZeroFox Intelligence Brief - Dark Web Competition Offers Insight into Threat Actor Focus
*What happened:* The results of competition “// XSSware” on Russian-speaking dark web forum “XSS” were announced on April 16. Projects focusing on obfuscation performed well, likely indicating a demand for accessible, free obfuscation tools within the threat actor community.
*Why it matters:* While the direct impact is very likely limited, the competition and winning projects will likely contribute to increasing efficiency in attack vectors, particularly as the projects are free to access by members of the forum. The top three projects have predominantly been awarded due to their perceived potential rather than their immediate application—with the exception of the first place PowerShell Stealer, which allegedly boasts immediate application. It is very likely that the total prize money of USD 20,000 awarded in the course of competition “// XSSware” will further fund threat actors in developing their malicious tools.

May 28, 2024
Pakistani Hackers Target Indian Critical Infrastructure
*What happened:* Cybersecurity researchers have discovered Pakistani APT group Transparent Tribe targeting the Indian government, defense, and aerospace sectors in a spear phishing campaign with cross-platform malware written in Python, Golang, and Rust.
*Why it matters:* Transparent Tribe is persistently targeting critical sectors vital to India's national security. The group's evolving tactics include cross-platform programming, open-source tools, and web services. Its actions and targets align with escalating India-Pakistan geopolitical tensions, suggesting a strategic motive. Threats from malicious cyber actors, such as Transparent Tribe, will likely persist and heighten amid the ongoing Indian general elections.

May 30, 2024
1.3 TB of Data Belonging to TicketMaster for Sale on BreachForums
*What happened:* On May 28, ZeroFox Intelligence observed threat actor ShinyHunters selling 1.3 TB of data, allegedly belonging to Live Nation Entertainment, the owner of ticket-selling platform Ticketmaster. The BreachForums post claims that the leaked data contains information about 560 million users, including names, addresses, email IDs, phone numbers, and credit card details. The threat actor has priced the database at USD 500,000.
*Why it matters:* ShinyHunters was one of the two administrators of BreachForums before Law Enforcement took the dark web marketplace down last week. The alleged Ticketmaster data breach is yet another indication that BreachForums is steadily being revived. Moreover, the leaked data can expose customer data to extortion scams, spear phishing attacks, and malicious actors. Besides, Live Nation Entertainment is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice because of its allegedly anti-competitive business practices and ""monopolistic control over the live events industry."" TicketMaster is likely to lose more credibility if the investigations prove that threat actors did breach its systems to steal customer data.

No worries! Any chance you could do 9:15 am at Variety Coffee Roasters (261 7th Ave, New York, NY 10001 or somewhere in this area broadly?) I have a call that ends at 9 am and a call that might be scheduled for 10 am so trying to finagle the schedule. I have some more time that afternoon as well before 4 pm.

CFO’s Journey to Modern Finance
Wednesday, June 5 | 11:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. PT
Few job functions have transformed as much as finance has in the past two decades. There has been a remarkable revolution—from the days of pen and paper through the rise of technology, data, and automation.

Join us for this session where leading advisor to senior finance leaders, Anders Liu-Lindberg, takes us on a tour through the Modern Finance Function.

Simplify Your Chart of Accounts and Increase Financial Visibility
Thursday, June 6 | 11:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. PT
Which line of business is most profitable? Why were labor costs so high last month? Is that subsidiary delivering expected results? Finding those answers should be easy. But a rigid account structure and a mile-long chart of accounts can make it nearly impossible to get the information you need when you need it.
Join this product demonstration webinar and learn how NetSuite helps you streamline your chart of accounts for optimal data analysis, faster reporting, and better insights into your business.

Thursday, June 6 | 11:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. PT
For discrete manufacturers in fast-moving industries, connecting ERP to product lifecycle management (PLM) and quality management (QMS) is vital for delivering the accurate data and connected workflows their teams need to move quickly and with confidence.
Join our webinar to explore why NetSuite and Propel are uniquely positioned to connect easily, launch quickly, and deliver greater user satisfaction compared to other ERP and PLM solutions.

Decibel Turns 5!

Decibel was founded 5 years ago to invest in technical founders at the earliest stage. So much has changed since our launch in 2019 but our founding values (https://www.decibel.vc/why-decibel) have stayed the same: Put Founders First. Have Conviction. Build Trust through Transparency. Run Towards the Fire.

Every founder can remember the significance of their early investors - they are true believers in your vision and show support when you need it most. It is our tradition every year to say “Thank You” to everyone who has been a part of the journey from the beginning - if you are on this list you are one of many friends, founders, investors, or partners who have helped us grow and expand over the past five years. Some recent milestones we reached this year include:
* Led 40 investments (https://decibel.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=84e2db3f3209f2680e78b3e3c&id=e4495aa6f9&e=958bfbff29) in Seed and Series A stage companies in our core investment areas of AI engineering, autonomous software, and cybersecurity.
* Announced the addition of Jess Leão (https://www.decibel.vc/articles/welcoming-jess-leao-as-decibels-newest-partner) and Lauren Ipsen (https://www.decibel.vc/articles/welcoming-lauren-ipsen-as-decibels-talent-partner) to our firm. We now have a team of 20 partners and founder advisors helping startups from the earliest stage.
* Grew our customer community to >2,000 early adopters in high-growth startups and Fortune 500 companies across every major technical domain.
* Expanded our reach into AI engineering in partnership with Latent Space (https://www.latent.space/) , which has become the leading podcast on all technical AI topics with over 2 million views since launch.
* Raised over $500 M in capital across our two funds from a diverse institutional LP base that shares our long term commitment to put founders first.

We are excited to share with you numerous updates on how our firm plans to evolve over the next 5 years and in many ways we are just getting started. The future is often fun to predict - how much can we all innovate to stay ahead in our rapidly changing world? We know that many things in our industry will undoubtedly change, but we also know that our values and commitment to founders will always stay the same.

Whether looking forward or back, I am reminded of the wisdom of a close mentor who has been in our industry for over 40 years: “In venture capital, your most valuable asset is not capital. It is trust. Be grateful to those that put their trust in you.” Thank you to everyone for putting your trust in our firm - we are very grateful to each and every one of you and would not be here without your support.

I look forward to seeing you all soon, and thank you again for being a part of the Decibel family.

Welcoming Jess Leão as Decibel’s Newest Investment Partner
We are excited to announce Jess Leão (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicamleao/)  as our newest investment partner. Jess was a forward deployed engineer at Palantir who later became a successful early stage VC investing in startups leveraging modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Her portfolio included some of the pioneers in Generative AI including MosaicML, which was recently acquired by Databricks for $1.3 Billion. In her first months at Decibel she led two investments (yet to be announced) and launched the AI Center of Excellence (https://www.decibel.vc/articles/launching-the-ai-center-of-excellence-moving-ai-from-prototypes-to-production) , a community of product and engineering executives from several dozen F500 enterprises who share best practices in building and deploying AI at scale.

Lauren joined Decibel and has been a force of nature since Day 1 placing numerous execs and rising stars inside of Decibel’s portfolio. Each of us sets ambitious goals to help our founders every quarter, and Lauren raised the bar to a new level in her first 100 days! Lauren was recruited to play golf in college and is a huge fan of the sport - in recognition of her performance, we presented her with Decibel’s first “green jacket (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7188555233332015104?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7188555233332015104%29) ”.

Prowler: Leading the Open Cloud Security Movement

Prowler (https://prowler.com/) is an open cloud security platform that breaks from the traditional “black-box” model by offering an easy-to-use, adaptable, and community-driven approach to the complex challenge of cloud security. With over 6 million downloads and hundreds of contributors from companies around the world, Prowler has quietly become one of the most widely used open source cloud security platforms due to its ability to make security posture actionable and specific to the unique demands of a customer's environment. This approach brings the same agility and adaptability seen in cloud engineering for the first time to cloud security. The company launched the open cloud security movement earlier this year and our seed investment was covered by VentureBeat (https://venturebeat.com/security/prowler-gets-6m-seed-to-build-out-hit-open-source-cloud-security-platform/) .

Dropzone AI: AI Assisted Reinforcements for Cybersecurity Teams, Raises Series A!

Dropzone AI (https://www.dropzone.ai/) is a new platform for deploying AI-assisted “reinforcements'' for cybersecurity operations. Professional hackers have the upper hand when targeting an organization, often using automated attacks to create an overwhelming number of security alerts. The vast majority of these events must be manually investigated, putting cybersecurity analysts at a disadvantage in what feels like an asymmetric war. Dropzone enables defenders to automate their front line of defense, leveraging the power of LLMs to autonomously investigate security alerts, create real-time context, and empower human analysts to respond to only the highest impact events. The company’s recent Series A was covered in VentureBeat (https://venturebeat.com/ai/dropzone-ai-raises-17m-from-theory-ventures-for-its-autonomous-cybersecurity-ai-agents/) .

Sublime: Rewriting the Rules of Email Security, Raises Series A!

Sublime (https://sublime.security/) is the first open security platform that lets anyone write, run, and share rules to detect and block email threats. Sublime has been rapidly growing and is now replacing major competitors in companies large and small. Founders Joshua Kamdjou and Ian Thiel saw a painful gap in the email security landscape that inspired them to start Sublime. Josh did offensive security at the Department of Defense for years, while Ian worked in product and growth at companies like Optimizely and Alto. Together, they’ve built a platform that rejects the traditional black box, walled-garden approach and instead empowers security teams to control their email environments by leveraging the power of a unified security community. The company’s recent Series A was covered in Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/04/24/ex-pentagon-hacker-raises-20-million-to-stop-chatgpt-fueled-cyberattacks/?sh=1a5fd8e6ea19) .

I am excited that it is getting closer to the day where I get to join
Jericho Security in the office! Now that it is my summer holidays, I have
taken a look at my training plan and I'm interested in starting my intern
role remotely as early as next week, till I fly over in August!

I have had a quick word with my program supervisor and he has given
clearance for me to ask for such an opportunity ☺️

I've taken some time to get a brief familiarisation of the web framework.
I've attached a demo video to an app for
patrol route optimisation *https://github.com/notbingsu/patrol-pal
<https://github.com/notbingsu/patrol-pal>*
which I partnered with a friend to develop as part of a hackathon.

If this sounds feasible, we can discuss the details! Looking forward to
hearing from you and thank you in advance for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Lu Bingyuan

As promised, I put together an estimate based on the scope we co-created on Friday, and I’ve attached it broken out by tasks, with all deliverables delineated. Take a look and let me know if you have any questions or if I should grab time on your calendar to talk through it together.

I’m also happy to provide references from CertifID or Kamsa, two tech companies that we performed similar projects for, working closely with the founders. Both hired us for additional work after we completed the positioning and editorial projects.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

TikTok Zero-Day Lets Hackers into CNN and Paris Hilton’s Accounts

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23672/ )

June 5, 2024
Hackers Exploit TikTok Zero-Day to Break into CNN Account
*What happened:* Threat actors exploited a TikTok zero-day bug to hijack high-profile accounts, including celebrities and companies, and plant malicious code on CNN’s official page. The now-patched flaw in the social media platform’s direct message feature allowed hackers to compromise accounts merely by having the target open a malicious message.
*Why it matters:* The White House has had TikTok on its radar recently, calling for its ban in the United States on national security grounds. In the run-up to the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, hackers are likely to conduct more such nuisance and disruptions in legitimate news sources to spread misinformation. Additionally, threat actors are likely to use information extorted from the hijacked high-profile accounts to target account holders in malicious attacks like phishing, extortion, and blackmail.

June 4, 2024
Data Breach at Australian Rare Earth Mining and Exploration Company
*What happened:* On June 4, 2024, ZeroFox observed an update on the BianLian ransomware leak site targeting Northern Minerals, an Australia-based mining company focused on the development of heavy rare earths projects. The breach included operational, shareholder, financial, and employee data.
*Why it matters:* Recently, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) warned of possible threats to its rare earths industry where threat actors aimed to steal state secrets. MSS stressed that some foreign enterprises had directed their operations in China to use their commercial activities as a cover to gather intelligence and internal data on the country’s rare-earth industry chain to steal commercial secrets and national secrets. It is possible that BianLian has similar motives of selling the breached operational details, Australian and foreign projects' documents, and research and development data to foreign actors looking to reduce their dependency on other countries for rare earth materials in its semiconductors, electrical vehicles, and weapons.

June 4, 2024
New V3B Phishing Kit Targets Customers of 54 European Banks
*What happened:* Threat actors are advertising a new phishing kit, V3B, on Telegram, targeting customers of 54 major financial institutions across Europe. Priced between USD 130 and USD 450 per month, it boasts advanced features like obfuscation, localization, OTP/TAN/2FA support, live chat with victims, and evasion mechanisms.
*Why it matters:* The emergence of V3B represents a significant advancement in phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms, offering sophisticated tools to facilitate cybercrime. Phishing kits like V3B can be utilized not only to harvest banking credentials and credit card details but also to facilitate broader follow-on cyberattacks. Moreover, the real-time interaction capability via the admin panel allows for customized phishing attempts, such as obtaining one-time passwords (OTPs), enhancing the kit's effectiveness in evading detection and perpetrating cybercrime. Its ability to evade detection by anti-phishing measures heightens the risk of successful phishing attacks, potentially leading to substantial financial losses and compromised personal information.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,sharon.hagi@gmail.com,"Hi Sage,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to thank you for your patience regarding the agreement. I have followed up with our legal team, and they are in the process of obtaining the necessary sign-off from our Chief Legal Officer. Unfortunately, he is currently out of the office on PTO until next week.

I have been assured that once he returns, he’ll be able to provide his official clearance and signature. At that point, I will promptly sign and return the agreement to you.

Thank you again for your understanding and patience.

Best,
Sharon.","Re: Updated invitation: Jericho Security CISO Advisor: Sharon Hagi @ Tue Apr 16, 2024 1pm - 1:30pm (EDT) (Sage Wohns)"

| ""It all began with a phone call to a prominent Hong Kong-based bank. The caller, posing as a high-ranking executive of a well-known company, requested an urgent transfer of funds.""

""The voice on the other end was familiar, or so it seemed. The bank manager, having dealt with this executive before, had no reason to suspect anything amiss.""

""But what the bank manager didn't know was that the voice he trusted was a meticulously crafted deepfake—a synthetic voice generated using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.""

| Verification and Authentication Procedures
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA for all financial transactions, including voice and video calls.
In-Person Verification: Require in-person verification or direct phone calls for large or unusual transactions.
Digital Signatures: Use digital signatures and encryption to verify the authenticity of communications and requests.
Training and Awareness
Employee Training: Regularly train employees on the risks of deepfake technology and how to recognize potential scams.
Phishing Simulation: Conduct phishing simulations and other cybersecurity drills to keep employees vigilant.
Technological Solutions
Deepfake Detection Software: Invest in deepfake detection tools to analyze video and audio for signs of manipulation.
AI-based Monitoring: Use AI and machine learning to monitor for unusual activity patterns that could indicate fraud.
Internal Controls and Procedures
Approval Processes: Establish stringent internal approval processes for…
This is a great start, but would like to see it be related back more to the context of the case. For example, requiring in person verification for the check would have prevented deepfake problems since it was such a large amount.

** NVidia + AI Growth
------------------------------------------------------------

Jumping right in this week. I’ve clearly been far too risk-averse when it comes to Nvidia. I’ve been concerned that their margins will be eroded by competitive forces like in-house design at Meta, Google, Amazon or Microsoft. While that may happen eventually, that’s not something that this market is concerned with at the moment.

I’ve started to wonder if NVidia’s actual advantage is less their technology and more that they have gobbled up all of the available physical resources needed to support the current configuration of top-tier AI. It turns out that building new power plants or substations is much harder than building new AI data centers, for example. Competitors can’t compete if they can’t access the physical resources needed to participate in the AI race.

There is a point when a company like NVidia becomes priced to perfection. I won’t prognosticate about where and when that happens. Besides the fact that Nvidia is in first place in the AI race, the links between NVidia’s sustained profitability and the overall AI economic opportunity are not clear-cut and dry to me. Leopold Aschenbrenner’s recent interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM&ab_channel=DwarkeshPatel) with Dwaresh Patel presented some interesting numbers to support the overall AI opportunity.

Let's break down how AI tools can generate a staggering $100B in incremental new revenue. Consider the 300 million Microsoft Office subscribers, which includes CoPilot, their AI model. If 1/3rd of these users opt for a next-gen AI product at $100/mo, that’s a whopping $100B in incremental revenue. This justifies investments in AI superclusters and the necessary power infrastructure to support it.

If 1/3rd of subscribers paying $100/mo sounds like a lot, consider how advanced these tools can become. ChatGPT costs $20/mo because it’s still relatively primitive compared to the opportunity. Leopold claims that GPT-4 with 100 tokens per minute is roughly equivalent to him thinking for three minutes. When AI models can process millions of tokens in a single problem-solving session, theoretically, that could translate to an output equivalent to months of work, not just minutes. AI models will eventually incorporate planning, drafting, critiquing and error-correcting, producing dramatically better outcomes. In that context, GPT-4 seems primitive. An additional $100/mo is a bargain if it enables an $8k/mo employee to produce months of incremental work.

I don’t know where NVidia goes from here. The economic impact and growth potential of AI are undeniably significant tailwinds. I’ll also add that the AI growth theme is too substantial to care about 5% per year base interest rates, so rate cuts, rate hikes or higher for longer really have no impact, but those rates will impact other assets and sectors.



** Private Credit - Part 2
------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote last week about the overall context of private credit. I like the framing that private credit is a portfolio of loans funded by private investors. Private credit risk boils down to whether the managers act as responsible stewards of capital. That said, some issues are starting to emerge. Here are some risks that will eventually sour the overall reputation of private credit.
* PIK stands for payment-in-kind or synthetic payment-in-kind. It occurs when the borrowers cannot afford their interest payments, so lenders accept additional debt or equity added to their balance in lieu of payment. Intuitively, this should seem problematic. It’s happening now, and it’s not transparently reported to investors. These would be the first questions I’d ask about. Each fund has different concentrations of PIK.
* Flawed valuations. Are these loans worth what their owners say they are? Some funds may be justifying higher valuations with questionable methods to prop up their values and keep investors happy. There are incentives for managers to misrepresent the value of their loans.
* Leverage. What’s worse than a bad loan portfolio? Answer: a bad loan portfolio with leverage. Many private credit funds are levered 100%. Not all private credit funds use leverage.
* Historical Justifications. This is the blind leading the blind. Private credit producing X% over various historical periods tells us nothing about the quality of the loans or the economic environment supporting those loans. You have to look forward even though the future is uncertain and complicated. There’s no way around that exercise. Sales tactics that use historical performance justifications to sell these funds should make you uneasy.
* Liquidity and Duration Mismatch. Many private credit funds have loans with 5-7 year durations but offer liquidity quarterly. The problem with bank loan risk is that they fund 5-7 year loans with daily liquid deposits, which enables bank run risk. Shifting the liquidity from daily to quarterly does not solve the problem. Realistically, investor durations need to better match loan durations.
* Defaults within Private Equity. A majority of private credit loans, by volume, are to private equity borrowers. Many funds say they only lend to private equity-backed companies for financial safety. It may seem like private equity is immune to losses given their incredible run over the past ten years. On Friday last week, Vista Equity Partners wrote down the value of PluralSight, their portfolio company, from $3.5B to $0. Many large private credit managers own PluralSight loans with leverage. What will the value of those loans be post-restructuring, and how many other private equity portfolio companies are hanging on by a thread? Owning exclusively senior debt does not solve the bankruptcy risk.

Fortunately, some private credit funds address these issues better than others. No fund is perfect, and every investment comes with unique and complicated risks. I feel that niche managers can do a better job avoiding these issues.

""The voice on the other end was familiar, or so it seemed. The bank manager, having dealt with this executive before, had no reason to suspect anything amiss.""

""But what the bank manager didn't know was that the voice he trusted was a meticulously crafted deepfake—a synthetic voice generated using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.""

Vermin Deploys SPECTR Malware to Exfiltrate Data

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23689/ )

June 6, 2024
“Vermin” Attacks the Defense Forces of Ukraine
*What happened:* Threat actor group “Vermin” was observed targeting Ukraine’s defense forces, according to the country’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) and Cyber Security Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (CCB). The threat group reportedly deployed the SPECTR malware to steal data.
*Why it matters:* Authorities suspect that the Vermin threat group is from currently Russia-occupied Luhansk and was last seen in 2022. The suspected reemergence of this group raises a likely chance that other old time notorious groups may emerge to aid Russia’s hybrid war efforts.

June 6, 2024
Los Angeles Unified School District Investigates Data Theft Claims
*What happened:* The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) officials are investigating claims made by a threat actor stating that they're selling stolen databases containing records of millions of students and thousands of teachers. Meanwhile, ZeroFox has *observed* ( https://cloud.zerofox.com/intelligence/advanced_dark_web/65559 ) threat actor Satanic claiming to sell data belonging to LAUSD on the predominantly English-language dark web forum, “BreachForums.""
*Why it matters:* This incident raises significant concerns about the security of sensitive personal data within educational institutions, affecting not only students but also teachers and staff. The threat actor offered CSV files on a hacking forum, allegedly containing over 11 GB of data, including sensitive personal information. If verified, the breach could have serious implications for the affected individuals, including identity theft and privacy violations. Additionally, it underscores the ongoing threat posed by cybercriminals targeting valuable data repositories.

June 6, 2024
U.S. Government Attempts to Recover a Trade Union’s Funds Stolen Via Business Email Compromise
*What happened:* The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to recover over USD 5 million stolen from a Massachusetts trade union by business email compromise scammers, who funneled the funds into accounts in China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Nigeria.
*Why it matters:* Business Email Compromise (BEC) is highly likely to remain a pertinent threat to organizations across industries as threat actors continue to capitalize upon established techniques, high success rates, and constantly increasing financial payoffs. A ZeroFox brief *released* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23360/ ) in April noted a sharp rise in BEC attacks due to their high success rates and lucrative returns. Several high-profile BEC attacks have been observed this year, including a campaign *targeting* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/22891/ ) Western states with promises of substantial profits. Another campaign involved a BEC-specialized hacker group *impersonating* ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-impersonate-us-government-agencies-in-bec-attacks/ ) several U.S. government agencies to reportedly steal corporate credentials, infiltrate mailboxes, and conduct follow-on business email compromise (BEC) activity.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,troy.belanger@sakscloudservices.com,"Hey Sage,

I'm not sure it was full accuracy.  So I'd like to confirm that.  I spoke
with Anitha and there were still some gaps.  She also has a list of items
we are discussing internally on Monday, once we review that list, we will
share with you and your team.  There's always a chance for
misinterpretation, so I want to be certain we are hearing the same thing.

I understand your goals with the product and our goals are aligned in that
we want a stable, simple, accurate, lightweight product to get our
associates/ employees educated with the smallest footprint possible.

Saks has had consistent success in partnering with startups because we
follow a due diligence process.  Once we complete our internal reviews, we
will be finalizing our results with other participants and I'll be happy to
review that information with you as we continue to build Jericho Security.

Sage, we are enjoying the collaboration and the lean, clean design UX of
Jericho Security.

Have a very good weekend,

bcc_email_sec_inbound,aholidayiii@645ventures.com,"Hi Sage, we hope this email finds you well. We wanted to follow up on our
conversation regarding Jericho Security and provide some additional
feedback.

Firstly, we wanted to express how impressed we have been with the speed at
which Jericho Security has been building. It's evident that your team is
dedicated and committed to delivering innovative solutions in the
cybersecurity space.

As we discussed, we believe that new trust and safety solutions are
becoming increasingly important, especially given the rapid rise of AI. We
appreciate your taking the time to demo the product and share customer
references with us. It has helped us gain a better understanding of how
current users are experiencing the product.

During our conversation, we touched on the potential for a strong
opportunity in prevention. While we understand that Jericho Security's
wedge is in training/education and that you already have an early
prevention product in the market, we would prefer to see the product in the
market a bit longer before committing to an investment. This will allow us
to assess the efficacy of the product and make a more informed decision as
it relates to differentiation from the competition.

We'd like to reiterate that we are actively investing in Series A and
Series B rounds, and our check sizes can go up to $15 million. We see great
potential in Jericho Security and would love to be kept up to date on the
progress. Additionally, as you roll out the prevention product, we would be
happy to explore ways in which we can be supportive, such as making
introductions to CISOs in our network.

Thank you again for considering our feedback. We look forward to staying
connected and continuing the conversation.

Best regards,
Aaron

DDoS “Hacktivism” Attacks Plague EU Political Parties amid Elections

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23701/ )

June 8, 2024
Hacktivists Target EU Political Parties in DDoS Attacks
*What happened:* Hacktivist group HackNet has claimed responsibility for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on election-related sites and political parties in the Netherlands, coinciding with the European Parliament elections. Agencies were able to thwart the attacks comprising three DDoS attack waves, peaking at 115 million and 44 million requests per hour.
*Why it matters:* Hacktivist attacks are more likely to be a general nuisance than a direct disruption in the election process or interference in the results. However, hacktivists can influence political landscapes and voter opinions, inconveniencing people and besmirching the electoral process, especially when the EU elections are underway. More hacktivists are likely to jump on the bandwagon and conduct such attacks during the election, thereby reflecting the increasing trend of politically motivated cyberattacks targeting democratic processes.

June 7, 2024
ZeroFox Intelligence Flash Report - ShinyHunters: An Insight into Future Extortion Tactics?
*What happened:* Threat actors have allegedly stolen the data of an unknown number of organizations via a compromise of the cloud data platform Snowflake. ZeroFox cannot yet independently confirm or deny the extent to which Snowflake is involved or how the alleged accessing of a demo environment could lead to the breach of multiple downstream customers. The full report can be accessed *here* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23697/ ).
*Why it matters:* ZeroFox anticipates there is a likely chance that other as-yet-unnamed organizations have also had data leaked, but may have chosen to buy back their data, or threat actors have yet to list it. The alleged breach of the cloud data platform Snowflake, and subsequent sale of data from alleged customers, may provide threat actors with a blueprint for the development of digital extortion tactics in the near future. The omission of encrypting payloads from extortion attacks will likely become increasingly popular amongst established extortion collectives—and will likely facilitate a larger pool of threat actors not historically involved in extortion to enter the digital extortion space.

June 7, 2024
750,000 People's Data Stolen in Frontier Communications Attack in April
*What happened:* American telecommunications company Frontier Communications has disclosed that a data breach (which was reported in the April 20 issue of ZeroFox’s Cyber Cyber Intelligence Daily Brief) affected over 750,000 individuals and exposed sensitive personal data, such as Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, credit scores, and phone numbers of customers. Last week, ZeroFox *observed* ( https://cloud.zerofox.com/intelligence/advanced_dark_web/65358 ) a post on the Ransomhub ransomware leak site targeting Frontier Communications, with a claim to have stolen 2 million customers’ data.
*Why it matters:* The exposed personal data creates opportunities for identity theft and fraud, potentially causing financial harm to affected individuals. Additionally, the stolen data can be leveraged for future cyberattacks, including phishing scams and targeted malware distribution, exploiting the compromised information to gain unauthorized access to accounts or perpetrate further breaches. Furthermore, the ransomware group's approach to selling stolen data, similar to their tactics following Christie's attack, indicates a pattern of criminal behavior aimed at monetizing illicitly obtained information. Meanwhile, the FCC has *proposed* ( https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-internet-routing-security-reporting-requirements-0 ) new rules for internet routing security, requiring Broadband providers to report their efforts in addressing vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

VULNERABILITY AND EXPLOIT INTELLIGENCE

CVE-2024-4577 ( https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4577 ) In PHP versions 8.1. before 8.1.29, 8.2. before 8.2.20, 8.3. before 8.3.8, when using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows may use ""Best-Fit"" behavior to replace characters in command line given to Win32 API functions. PHP CGI module may misinterpret those characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc.

Affected products: PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3. before 8.3.8.

hi everyone!

NY Tech Week 2024 is officially wrapped up! We had a record-breaking 740+ events (almost 2X growth from last year), tens of thousands of attendees, and so much diversity in the themes that were represented. AI was the most predominant theme, with fireside chats from companies on the bleeding edge, demo days and pitch competitions, talks by the mayor, and the convergence of so many industries from fintech, gaming, crypto, healthcare, cybersecurity and so much more. The NYC ecosystem is on a meteoric rise. (https://x.com/KatiaAmeri/status/1800159408770715799)

bcc_email_sec_inbound,shawn.tyrie@mcchrystalgroup.com,"Hi Grace and Sage,

Please see the marked up version of the contract.  This thing truly has taken an eternity and I’m sorry for that.  Some questions I’d need guidance from your team would be on if we sell the co-created thing(s), who is the contract with the buyer going to be with? Will the buyer have individual agreements with each of us, paying us individually - or does the originating party handle the agreement and then pay the other party their portion? If the latter – will there be a way to track the sales and ensure proper split is issued? And do we need to create a three-way agreement template for MG, Jericho, and the buyer so we are all in the loop and using the same terms?  I’m not experienced enough in these agreements to 1) make a recommendation and 2) know what is comfortable for you.

Let me know how you’d like to move forward.

Hi Afiba and Shawn,

Great seeing you both today. As discussed, please find the updated contract attached for your legal team's review.

For next steps, I'll start drafting content for the Roundtable and the Offsite - @Shawn, if you could share any examples or templates of current McChrystal Group tabletop content, that would be much appreciated.

## NOTES

Hey there,

* Today’s a big religious day for me, perhaps my Holiest day. Yes, the WWDC Keynote. And this year it included massive updates that I absolutely loved. My quick couple of thoughts:

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1800235992978468885)

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1800286299070603759)

* **Prety disappointed none of the main AI features seem to be in the iOS18 betas that were just released. So basically everything is for later this year? Booo.**

* Later today I’m going to train kickboxing for the first time formally—other than one-off lessons. Pretty sure I’m going to sign up at the place and alternate between kickboxing and jits.

* **One of the most important conversations ever on AI Safety. A must-watch**. It’s 4.5 hours and better than any movie.

Youtube: Leopold Aschenbrenner - 2027 AGI, China/US Super-Intelligence Race, & The Return of History (https://youtu.be/zdbVtZIn9IM)

* Wrote a [new Fabric pattern called ](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)`capture_thinkers_work`, which does a capture of a thinker, author, or philosopher’s work. So basically their background, their main ideas, the work they produced, and more. Example:

`echo ""hayek"" | fabric -sp capture_thinkers_work`


* My thread on how to find a good mentor:

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1616200314478276608)

* Experimenting with adding source names to stories now so people can see where they’d be taken. A frequently-requested feature.

Ok, let’s get to it…

Hope you are doing well !

I am a Columbia Business School student and am interested in the Sales and Go-to-market internship at Jericho Secutiry. I have a pre-MBA background in fintech (Citi and Nomura ) and strategy and business development at B2B and B2C  SaaS start-ups( logistics, health and wellness). Additionally, during my first year at Business school, I have taken on few projects in strategy - particularly Go-to-market and pricing.

Dina mentioned the opportunity at Jericho Security and her great experience working with you. I really enjoy working in dynamic start-ups  building products from the ground up and so I am interested in learning more about Jericho Security's product.

I would love to have a chat with you about the role and my motivations. I have attached my resume. Please let me know if you need any further information from my end.

Looking forward to hearing from you !

Best,

Brightwave: An AI Investment Research Assistant For Everyone

We are excited to announce our investment in Brightwave (https://decibel.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=84e2db3f3209f2680e78b3e3c&id=abc852ab5c&e=e9fe5ab43d) , the AI research assistant purpose-built for investment professionals. Generative AI has been one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years but its application for investment professionals have been limited to summarizing documents and asking questions of SEC filings. Brightwave is the first AI research assistant that generates trustworthy financial analysis on any investment topic. It helps users reason about risks and opportunities within specific markets and sectors, draw links between disparate topics such as rare earth metals and GPU production, and can provide sentence-level attribution for every research claim. Investors get more than facts and information - they get insights that help guide real-time investment decisions based on reasoning and analysis done at internet-scale.

As a CFO, your role extends beyond financial wizardry

Smart CFOs know that expanding into new products, exploring different regions, and increasing sales teams isn’t all about data and spreadsheets. Essential soft skills are needed to successfully lead through the unexpected twists and turns that come with business expansion.
The success of a company’s growth plan hinges on the art of effective leadership.
Join us in a discussion with finance expert Kyle Hegarty and explore the art of business expansion through the lens of a CFO, with a focus on essential soft skills needed to succeed.

 Hi Grace,
 We are constantly evaluating our policy templates and incorporating feedback from audit partners and customers. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we reviewed our policy offerings and have decided to make two additional policies available to all of our frameworks by default.
 The policies will impact your readiness score if you are not already managing them. We will release the following two policies next Tuesday:
 - Change Management Policy - This will cover requirements for managing other types of changes that are not related to software development, which were the only types of changes covered by our existing Software Development Life Cycle policy template. This policy was previously only associated with select frameworks and now it will be pre-mapped to all by default.
 - Logging and Monitoring Policy - This was added because we did not have a specific policy template covering these specific topics. While there was some language in some policies around logging in, it was scattered across different templates.
 In order to get back your previous readiness, you have two options:
 - Option 1: Archive the policies. You're not required to adopt these policies. If you have an existing compliance program that does not include these policies and do not wish to adopt them, you can archive them.
- Option 2: Adopt the policies. Your other option is to adopt these policies. Review the contents, customize as needed, approve them, and then send them to your employees to acknowledge, if applicable. You may also consider reviewing their contents and copying into your existing policies if you do not wish to use these stand-alone templates.
 Reminder: The two policies will be added on June 18, 2024.
 Thanks,
 Ashley Hyman VP of Customer Experience",Important: Two New Policies for All Frameworks

I have two questions regarding the coding assignment:

   1. Are there any rules for the entry and exit points? Should they be set
   on the border of the maze, or can they be random points within the maze?
   2. When accessing previously generated mazes, should these mazes
   demonstrate a graphical representation of the solution again, or are they
   just for viewing?

Thank you,

Snowflake Compromise Claims Another Victim

Fill out a quick survey ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYOMgNrIQTrOFEmzo3NOmGzMCVND3ysap-5Q3Mn47ET6IzHA/viewform?usp=sf_link )

( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23717/ )

June 11, 2024
Pure Storage Discloses Data Breach Caused by Snowflake Workspace Compromise
*What happened:* Pure Storage *confirmed* ( https://support.purestorage.com/bundle/m_security_bulletins/page/Pure_Security/Security_Bulletins/topics/concept/c_Security_Bulletin_for_Unauthorized_Access_to_Telemetry_Information.html ) a breach involving its Snowflake data analytics workspace, adding it to the list of victims affected in the Snowflake cyberattack. Pure Storage has confirmed that although some telemetry information (including company names and email addresses) was exposed, the breach did not compromise customer data.

*Why it matters:* The threat analysis firm hired to investigate the Snowflake credentials compromise has *attributed* ( https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/11/crims_targeting_snowflake_customers/ ) it to threat actor group UNC5537. The firm further stated that the adversary has hacked into 165 organizations with the help of stolen Snowflake credentials. In a report released earlier this month, ZeroFox also *warned* ( https://www.zerofox.com/advisories/23697/ ) that more organizations, besides TicketMaster and Santander, might have had data leaked. It is also important to note that the breach sets precedents for future digital extortion tactics, with a trend toward omitting payload encryption to attract more threat actors.

June 11, 2024
City of Cleveland Shuts Down IT Systems After Cyberattack
*What happened:* The City of Cleveland took its citizen-facing services, like public offices and City Hall, down after a cyberattack. Ongoing investigations reveal the incident has not impacted any essential services like healthcare and utility.
*Why it matters:* Investigations are still underway to determine the type of cyberattack. No threat actor has claimed the attack and neither has any ransom been demanded, at the time of writing. However, Cleveland has a population of two million and is considered to be a significant economic center in Ohio. Forcing the city to take some of its services offline could mean backlogs and delays, which could cause financial losses.

June 11, 2024
Massive Global DNS Probing by Chinese Actor SecShow
*What happened:* Cybersecurity researchers have identified a Chinese actor, SecShow, conducting large-scale Domain Name System (DNS) probing since June 2023. SecShow operates from the China Education and Research Network (CERNET), a project funded by the Chinese government.
*Why it matters:* The researchers have warned that the probes in question targeting DNS responses at open resolvers could facilitate future malicious activities. Threat actors can use open DNS resolvers in various cyberattacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. SecShow's use of IP Address Spoofing Techniques raises concerns about data gathering for undisclosed purposes, highlighting the risks of transparency and security. The activity mirrors another China-linked threat actor, Muddling Meerkat, known to demonstrate a pattern of prolonged, undetected probing.

bcc_email_sec_inbound,gary@phishcloud.com,"Cyber criminals use popular topics as phishing-phodder, and the 2024 Olympics will be no different.  It's time for PhishCloud!

Sage, I'm on vacation this week, enjoying some sun, sand and suds.  Unfortunately, cyber crime never takes a vacation, and here's an article you need to know about:  Phishing for Gold: Cyber Threats Facing the 2024 Paris Olympics | Google Cloud Blog (https://d2pKYG04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RJ+113/d2pKYG04/VWczhd2FWYLzW8y0D3M7Y5xM9W5l3Nw35ggg44N7gG80q3pyd0W95jsWP6lZ3q3Vzd3xd2XvLTkW3SB4-f23cffhW4WtgCy3Ng5WyW5g3--4228z5DN2BSFYmPFh3CMSZytqHvVLKW8X2mSy5khHBCW3x9Rpf8R17fxW2PBzVn6S7-2QW4PnPQ142VqH0W89B1Yr5P7f1NW56tF5K19YsxvW5vXdzL4c-2BMMrPQvsZWSfKW12M3dS7f5tJGW1MZJwK4kw1xfW6w3FdW8zKzn3VR2hRC3fSqclN8cFyN3l8zsVW1wSQ0V27SW-tM1xw2kD5rx-W7j70hh1NLlQ8W6_szQt6Cv6phW4spj5L8F31G3W6DlTS61PyMcSN1ZR8fm7cxG_W8Zk65d80MB0tN7mlx4WKZ1jbMkqHVkZTL2SW4HfN0x945g-jf2FQ7nH04 ) .

According to Mandiant, ""Olympics-related cyber threats could realistically impact various targets including event organizers and sponsors, ticketing systems, Paris infrastructure, and athletes and spectators traveling to the event. Financially motivated actors are likely to target the Olympics in various ways, including ticket scams, theft of PII, and extortion against entities during a period of heightened pressure. Capitalizing on interest in the games, threat actors are likely to use Olympics-related lures in social engineering operations that are not necessarily targeting the games.""

As with any other popular topic, the Olympics presents opportunities for phishing scams in both email and social media.  Unsuspecting employees clicking on a link to learn more about an Olympic event can unknowingly download malware, giving a cyber criminal an entry point to you organization.

You need real-time visibility and control over the attacks your employees see so they can be blocked before they happen.  The ONLY solution that allows this is PhishCloud!

It's time for change.  It's time for PHISHCLOUD!

Smishing is a rapidly evolving form of phishing, where hackers send SMS messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Over the past year, there has been a worrying increase in these attacks.

FACT: Only 35% of the population know what smishing is (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://d4Lz-q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RL*113/d4Lz-q04/VX6PMr1Cmhn5N55zCb6sNCKqW842MfZ5ggpjJN1YBnw43pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3mNW4C50m87DV6d1W6hBv_f3R2k7rW5pQ9w148v4DJN7ZVh3GBsfhTW5wC-S61l2lGDW2SbPvJ29zGnbW96NXhk23b13LW6tG3sW2L8SvlW7Jr6fJ3Hvk6DW7TPcK32rP062W1GqWhh26xjxyW3MyjZS1mq4_0N3N0nP7t7PFPW7W7GkL93D2N9W12XVRz3GJ-Y0N1z6R5l_8G-6N7l4VHyrqM9QW7vz_Yg3S4NvmW4_7Clg3mkL3nVK7mgR8mHm2CW45Dsgk4cCY2mW87k3hk2yCK2VW5fy4_45m9YCdW4Dmrk-8J5LqVF1GMNflgt8NW7vB0pY5PD9F6N7zX6N2jNg2sM-cwPPXtn32dQ0pVY04__;Kw!!AgknpJoImQ!lTPLVZEtcFdt6QT5EX2IayzPl-kDpJMJv4ESPe2GI9m8PKWyCeve9GMUwFhXsm9i12Stf4dolmqX8hwUgw$  ) , according to a survey by Safety Detectives. The lack of awareness, combined with the high response rates to SMS messages, makes smishing one of the most threatening cyber attacks today.

Hi Mohamad Iyan Danial

Thanks for joining us for our SMX Advanced demo session, How to create thousands of custom campaigns in seconds with Fluency Blueprints. We hope we made it easy for you to imagine how your teams can launch and optimize thousands of custom, data-powered campaigns, and at scale with Blueprints.

We will be sharing the on-demand recording as soon as it's available. In the meantime, we wanted to make sure you had a few other resources.

Smishing is a rapidly evolving form of phishing, where hackers send SMS messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Over the past year, there has been a worrying increase in these attacks.



FACT: Only 35% of the population know what smishing is<https://d4Lz-q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/RL+113/d4Lz-q04/VWgHz37SDwblVt6Z3_4dWXWhW6D6W6y5ggptrN6G5Tr-3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3m_MbLGB74t4D7W77sK9f4zTzJQW6G-D7h8bqGQ7W7-PByt2G5fwTW31RkF596w2H1W73wcxx8PRMhXW89W3Mr4qCW25W3gprxs2LjjxwW4dKgKH4h8ZtRMhr54lhTbcLW4L46Yt1C3GfnW5lkSQy8CZ10tW3bXRzK2HRlVzN2nkLm-7kly3W6zqKw33y-z8qW3mrQld528vY-W1_vFbQ6qGhdqW41pCWt95cF0QVwWmJp92yPkkW7Ntd004ZmRR9VQ06Yl5Qmt4pVc6DMJ17-5zlW4983HC4VW2tQN6f64QDgYL-NW18Xn007Q_rCHW1Vc8xC4NsV0DW5LX7Xv5S9n1BW1LhPYF1LPDGkf8QdTFd04>, according to a survey by Safety Detectives. The lack of awareness, combined with the high response rates to SMS messages, makes smishing one of the most threatening cyber attacks today.

Thank you for completing that so promptly.

Joel has raised all the queries in Drata, as soon as you have responded
to/uploaded additional evidence to them we can begin the reporting process
that usually takes 1-2 weeks once all evidence has been verified.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

North Korean APT Set to Poison Open-Source Repositories

North Korea’s Moonstone Sleet Expands its Targets to the Software Supply Chain
*What happened:* A North Korean APT called Moonstone Sleet, which was identified last month, has expanded its distribution of malicious node package manager (npm) code to public repositories, posing a threat to the software supply chain by poisoning open-source code repositories.
*Why it matters:* As reported in ZeroFox’s Cyber Daily Intelligence Brief of May 30, researchers *discovered* ( https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/microsoft-moonlight-sleet-apt-melds-espionage-financial-goals ) Moonstone Sleet conducting financially motivated attacks and cyberespionage campaigns. While its quick expansion of techniques warrants attention, Moonstone Sleet's targeting of the software supply chain is also indicative of the growing risk to the open-source ecosystem, as demonstrated by the large-scale impact of previous supply chain attacks. Supply chain attacks affect all users of the compromised software and can have widespread consequences for government, critical infrastructure, and private sector software customers. With China’s persisting geopolitical tensions with other nations, other Chinese state-sponsored actors will likely follow Moonstone Sleet’s suit to conduct supply chain attacks.

June 14, 2024
ZKTeco Biometric System Found Vulnerable to 24 Critical Security Flaws
*What happened:* Researchers have detected 24 vulnerabilities in a hybrid biometric access system from Chinese manufacturing company ZKTeco. The flaws include SQL injections, stack-based buffer overflows, and command injections.
*Why it matters:* These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to defeat authentication, steal biometric data, and deploy malicious backdoors. Exploiting them can lead to significant risks since attackers can sell biometric data on the dark web, allowing actors to potentially create deepfakes and conduct sophisticated social engineering attacks.

June 13, 2024
NATO to Crack Down on Russian Spies in Response to Sabotage
*What happened:* NATO has decided to undertake “tougher action” against Russia in light of recent acts of sabotage and cyberattacks, including disinformation, against NATO allies.
*Why it matters:* The military alliance also plans to prioritize protecting its maritime and cyber infrastructure while tightening restrictions on Russian intelligence personnel. The added security measures may be instrumental in safeguarding member states to better protect themselves from recent Russia-led cyberattacks where a Russian-backed cybercampaign *targeted* ( https://reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/russian-cyber-attacks-targeted-defence-aerospace-sectors-berlin-says-2024-05-03/ ) government bodies, ""critical infrastructure operators"" and other entities in Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden.

London Hospitals Cyber Incident Causes Severe O Positive and O Negative Blood Shortage
*What happened:* England's NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has urgently called for O positive and O negative blood donors to book appointments and donate following last week’s cyberattack on pathology provider Synnovis. Many non-urgent procedures have been canceled or redirected.
*Why it matters:* The attack disrupted services at multiple hospitals in London, making it difficult to quickly match blood donor and recipient types. This raises the risk of transfusion mismatches, which could lead to life-threatening complications. The London hospital incident is part of a series of ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations this year, which have compromised patient services and exposed sensitive data. The much-publicized and disruptive impact of attacking healthcare services makes these organizations lucrative targets for extortion, potentially endangering patient lives.

ZeroFox Intelligence Flash Report - Threat Actor Linked to ShinyHunters Advertises Extortionate Data Breach
*What happened:* On June 11, 2024, untested threat actor “sp1d3r'' advertised the sale of a notably-large leaked data set in the Russian-speaking dark web forum xss. The breach allegedly contains 65,000 records of data stolen from a U.S.-based financial organization that purportedly include both personal financial information (PFI) and personally identifiable information (PII).
*Why it matters:* The owner of this stolen data is likely a victim of the ongoing fallout of the alleged breach of cloud-based service provider Snowflake. Since the alleged breach on May 23, 2024, several of Snowflake’s assumed customers’ data have been advertised on deep and dark web (DDW) forums. Sp1d3r is almost certainly synonymous with, or heavily associated with, threat actor “ShinyHunters”, who is very likely responsible for recent attacks against Snowflake customers. In the coming weeks, it is very likely that additional Snowflake customers will be implicated in data breaches, with the stolen information being advertised for sale in DDW forums.

June 12, 2024
City of Cleveland Shuts Down IT Systems After Cyberattack
*What happened:* The City of Cleveland took its citizen-facing services, like public offices and City Hall, down after a cyberattack. Ongoing investigations reveal the incident has not impacted any essential services like healthcare and utility.
*Why it matters:* Investigations are still underway to determine the type of cyberattack. No threat actor has claimed the attack and neither has any ransom been demanded, at the time of writing. However, the City of Cleveland has a population of two million and is considered to be a significant economic center in Ohio. Forcing the city to take some of its services offline could mean backlogs and delays which could cause financial losses.

Dear Customer, We're pleased to announce that your online banking platform business Bridge® Premier will soon be updated to include several improvements. These enhancements will make it easier and more convenient for you to manage your accounts online. Best of all, there's no action required to take advantage of these updated features. What do I need to know? Important Date -
System changes will take effect on Monday, June 24, 2024 . Same Login and Account Settings - All online banking settings will remain unchanged, including accounts, services, users, and all ACH and Wire Payment information (if applicable). Login Challenge Questions - For your security, you may be asked to answer and/or update your security challenge questions. What is changing? Payment Reports - To improve access for reviewing and approving ACH and Wire transactions, the Summary and Detail reports are now available directly from the Payment Center. Account Export functionality - A new Excel export option is now available in the Account Activity, Prior Day, and Current Day pages. Account Views in Account Activity
- To make is easier for viewing transaction activity, a new 'Relative Date' search option will be available allowing the user to select date range parameters. An 'Edit my View' option will also be available so that users may create and save a customer default view of their account transaction history. Recipients for Foreign Currency Wires - To help prevent wires from being rejected, Beneficiary Address Country Code is now required. Users will now have to select the Country/Region for their recipients from a drop-down menu. Previously, users had to enter the Country/Region manually as part of the address line. Bank Security Alerts for Non-admin Users - To assist in managing user updates, non-admin / sub users can now enroll for bank security alerts pertaining to online banking profile changes. Removal of USD Wire Transfers Options - Remittance Information Option will be removed on free form or templates for USD Wires. Remittance Information that was previously applied will be removed. If you have any remittance information you need to carry over, you can move the information to the 'Details of Payments' field prior to the upgrade. Order Customer Option will be removed on all wire payment types. Information entered in 'Senders Reference Field' will no longer be included in outgoing wire messages. Mobile App Updates: For added convenience, users can now create ACH and Wire payments from an approved template. Biometric Opt Out Option - Users will now have the option to disable the biometrics (Face ID / Fingerprint) for Mobile App login.
Additional important information To ensure wire payments are processed accurately and efficiently , we encourage you to include complete beneficiary name and address along with any additional payment information (ex. invoice number, types of goods/services purchased). This information can be included under the ""Details of Payment"" field on the wire form. USD International Wires Intermediary Banks - We currently have several preferred Intermediary Banks, including Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, and BNY Mellon. For your convenience, we always include one as a default, and recommend saving them in your 'Preferred Bank List' in the Payment Center. The Intermediary Bank may convert your USD international wire into local currency. If you are sending the wire to a beneficiary with a USD Account and do not want the funds auto converted to the local currency, please put ""DO NOT CONVERT"" in the OBI/Details of Payment field. Below you will find a User Guide that will help you understand the required data that is specific to the country where the wire is being sent, and details about the Intermediary Bank fee deductions. [<https://preview.eastwestbank.com/bridgeblastresources/Outgoing Wire Instructions and Country Codes_User Guide June 2024_Final.pdf>] What should I do to prepare? Prior to the upgrade: If you have any payment remittance information in existing templates that you need to carry over, please move the information to the 'Details of Payment' field, lines 1-4.
Share this information with all your company users. Review the enclosed Key Changes document for detailed information about these updated features. Visit our [Business Training Center <https://www.eastwestbank.com/en/small-mid-size-businesses/training-center>]
to access all our online banking training resources, should you need it.

Good evening Daniel,



My name is Tyler and I’m one of Jericho Security’s corporate counsel at WSGR. It’s great to meet you!



We’ve attached here YC’s standard form of pro rata side letter. Please let us know if this form works on your end.



We’ve also attached a summary of the company’s cap table. One percent of the company’s 11M fully diluted shares comes out to 110,000 shares. We’ll update your grant accordingly in the advisor agreement.



The company is in the process of wrapping up it’s SAFE financing. Once the company has completed its raise, we’ll commission a new 409A valuation to determine the fair market value of the shares. At this point, the board can grant your
options.



Would you mind providing the signature block information for your SAFE? If everything else is in order, we can circulate documents for signatures whenever you’re ready to proceed.



Best,

bcc_email_sec_inbound,tracy.cohen@us.sumitomo-pharma.com,"Hey Nate,

Those domains are the only ones we’re expecting, and the count is just about right because we’re around 1,200-1,300 users right now, and each user actually has two accounts because some domains are legacy domains we are migrating off of.

The new domains we would want to send simulated phishing to are:

us.sumitomo-pharma.com
ch.sumitomo-pharma.com
ca.sumitomo-pharma.com

The others are all legacy domains that we are phasing out, everyone present on those domains also has an account and mailbox in one of the three domains above.
